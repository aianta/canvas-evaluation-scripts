        This page describes the Speculative Policy Prototyping Workshop for Speculative Design for Public Futures 318
        The workshop goal is to practice design led approaches for imagining and testing policy interventions that respond to public challenges. Students will learn methods for rapid policy sketching, narrative prototyping, and low fidelity testing with community personas to surface unintended consequences and power dynamics.
        Format and schedule - Three live sessions plus an asynchronous sprint. Session 1 - Framing constraints and norm mapping; Session 2 - Prototyping techniques and peer testing; Session 3 - Public feedback simulation and final pitches. Asynchronous work includes research, prototype development, and a reflective journal entry between sessions.
        Core activities - Rapid policy sketching and policy artifact creation; Scenario mapping and impact ladders; Persona based role play and tabletop testing; Creation of tangible engagement assets such as visual briefs, mock public notices, and short performative scripts to surface public responses.
        Deliverables and assessment - Team submission of two artifacts: a concise speculative policy brief and a prototype engagement asset. Assessment split includes peer feedback for 20 percent, instructor evaluation for 50 percent, and the reflective journal for 30 percent. Rubrics focus on plausibility, ethical reflection, clarity of public benefit, and attention to equity.
        Ethical guidance - Prototypes must avoid causing harm and must surface who benefits and who may be disadvantaged. Each submission needs a mitigation plan for potential harms and a plan for consent and data minimization when testing with people.
        Sample LMS discussion excerpt - Instructor - Please document key assumptions behind your prototypes and test them with at least two distinct community perspectives. Student A - We are prototyping a skills linked basic support policy and want feedback on how to make trade offs legible. Student B - Consider a pilot metric set that centers lived experience and access rather than only economic outputs. Instructor - Strong idea, draft a short evaluation plan before the next session for peer review.
        Support and logistics - Virtual office hours Thursdays 3 to 4 PM and by appointment. Upload draft artifacts to the workshop folder by Friday midnight to allow time for peer review and instructor comments.

      :Text: Urban soil health is foundational to resilient city food systems and
        depends on rigorous, place based research and inclusive stewardship. Soil
        science approaches such as systematic soil testing, profile description, and
        biological assays guide practices for building organic matter, enhancing nutrient
        cycling, and managing contaminant risk—especially in older urban neighborhoods.
        Community engaged methods combine participatory mapping, garden sampling,
        and open data sharing to center local knowledge and promote equitable access
        to safe growing spaces. Restoration techniques like composting, cover cropping,
        phytoremediation, and reduced tillage support soil structure and microbial
        diversity while reducing reliance on external chemical inputs. Linking soil
        stewardship to community food networks strengthens local distribution, supports
        culturally relevant diets, and builds collective capacity for food sovereignty.
        Municipal policy, accessible training, and targeted remediation funding are
        essential to scale evidence based interventions and protect public health
        from untested or well meaning but potentially harmful practices

        emphasize careful site selection, sterile sampling, in situ measurement, and
        comprehensive metadata collection. Instruments range from handheld spectrometers

        profiling and biosignature detection. Strict contamination control and planetary
        protection protocols preserve sample integrity and prevent forward contamination.
        Results are validated through reproducible workflows, cross disciplined collaboration,
        and peer reviewed publication to separate robust evidence from speculation.
        Mastery of these techniques allows students to assess habitability using observational

           treated as a distinct communicative environment shaped by procedural norms role relations and strategic

        finance projects with clear environmental benefits and often include use of
        proceeds restrictions, independent verification, and ongoing reporting.  Key
        fundamentals include project eligibility, alignment with green taxonomies,
        third party certification, and robust impact metrics that enable transparency
        and investor confidence.  Market participants range from sovereign and municipal
        issuers to development banks and corporations each facing trade offs between
        cost of capital and credibility.  Investors evaluate credit risk, climate
        related transition and physical risks, and the integrity of labeling to avoid
        greenwashing.  Policy frameworks taxation incentives and standardised disclosure
        regimes play a central role in scaling issuance and improving market liquidity.  Case

        This page defines responsible disclosure and bug bounty practices for Ethical Hacking and Civic Cybersecurity 304. It sets expectations for authorized testing, safe proof of concept development, concise reporting, legal considerations, and coordination with vendors and incident response teams. Adhering to these practices protects students, researchers, and community partners and reinforces ethical and civic minded security work.
        Guiding principles and rules
        - Obtain explicit authorization before testing any system or service
        - Limit testing to agreed scope and avoid collateral impact on third party users
        - Do not exfiltrate or retain sensitive data and avoid destructive techniques such as denial of service
        - Avoid social engineering and physical intrusion unless explicitly permitted
        Reporting expectations
        - Provide a short summary of the issue and its practical impact on users or services
        - Include clear reproduction steps and a minimal proof of concept
        - Describe root cause analysis and suggested remediation or mitigation steps
        - Estimate severity and potential mitigations based on risk to civic infrastructure
        Timelines and disclosure
        - Report issues privately to the responsible party and course staff when relevant
        - Allow a standard remediation window of 90 days before public disclosure unless urgent risk requires earlier action
        - Coordinate public disclosure to ensure fixes are available and to prevent harm
        Recognition and rewards
        - Researchers who follow these practices will be acknowledged in a manner agreed with the affected party
        - Bug bounties or course credit may be awarded based on impact and quality of the report
        Legal and safety notes
        - Ensure your work complies with applicable laws and the institution code of conduct
        - If in doubt seek prior approval from course instructors or legal advisors
        Contact and escalation
        - Use the official course reporting channel to submit findings and to request safe harbor or authorization
        - In emergencies contact the instructor and the campus security team for coordinated response
        Following these guidelines helps build trust between researchers and defenders and supports responsible, civic focused cybersecurity scholarship
