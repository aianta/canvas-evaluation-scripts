    submissions:
    - body: '<p>My visual narrative titled Family of Futures is a three panel storyboard
        that tracks a household across three moments of transformation The first panel
        is grounded in current trends and depicts a multigenerational household adapting
        to hybrid work rhythms and shifting care arrangements The second panel moves
        into a near future where public infrastructure has been redesigned to support
        distributed kin networks This image emphasizes communal care hubs shared kitchens
        and time banking systems The third panel is a speculative twist that imagines
        a municipal program that recognizes non biological bonds as civic kinship
        and provides legal and social supports for chosen families</p>

        <p>The visuals use a muted palette for the present to convey familiarity and
        a warmer palette for the near future to suggest increased connection Finally
        the speculative panel introduces brighter unexpected colors and symbolic motifs
        that signal cultural change The written rationale ties each panel to course
        topics The first panel reflects the concept of publics as overlapping audiences
        who negotiate resources and attention The second panel applies critical prototyping
        to imagine how design interventions in public space can redistribute care
        labor The third panel draws on imaginaries to push beyond incremental change
        and challenge dominant narratives about kinship</p>

        <p>Methodologically I combined research into demographic trends with small
        scale interviews and a rapid prototyping exercise in which I tested visual
        metaphors with three classmates The feedback led me to refine the representation
        of communal infrastructures so that they read as accessible rather than utopian
        I also used annotations in the panels to point to policy levers and technological
        affordances that could support each future</p>

        <p>Ethically I considered the risks of erasing difference and amplifying a
        single cultural model of family To counter this I included diverse bodies
        and caregiving practices and I noted tensions in the rationale The speculative
        panel intentionally includes unresolved questions to invite public dialogue
        rather than present a blueprint</p>

        <p>In relation to course readings the project engages Dao and Patel on speculative
        futures by using narrative to make abstract systems tangible It also draws
        on the idea of design as intervention from class workshops by proposing low
        cost pilots for the second panel The goal of the assignment was to produce
        a narrative that can live in public conversation and prompt reflection on
        what publics might be willing to support and how design can enable different
        forms of belonging</p>

        <p>Overall this visual narrative connects personal observation with policy
        thinking and design practice It aims to invite viewers to imagine family as
        a civic concern and to consider practical steps that move us toward more inclusive
        futures</p>

    submissions:
    - body: <p>My counterfactual explores a world where decentralized municipal networks
        were prioritized in the 1970s instead of centralized telephone monopolies.
        I argue that when local governments invested in open network infrastructure
        early, communities developed resilient civic platforms that reshaped urban
        governance, labor relations, and public education. The presentation outlines
        three key consequences. First, municipal networks enabled distributed civic
        services such as neighborhood planning forums and localized data commons,
        reducing reliance on national corporations for public coordination. Second,
        the early adoption of open protocols fostered new forms of cooperative labor
        in tech and infrastructure, producing stronger municipal employment ecosystems
        and different social welfare outcomes. Third, schools integrated networked
        learning much earlier, creating pedagogies oriented around community knowledge
        exchange and participatory curriculum design. The slide deck includes archival
        analogues, speculative artifacts, and a timeline that maps inflection points
        and feedback loops. The written summary reflects on the epistemic limits of
        counterfactuals, the risks of romanticizing alternative pasts, and concrete
        design attitudes that practitioners can carry into contemporary policy work.</p>
      feedback:
        comment: Strong imaginative framing and clear links to public policy implications.
          To improve, cite specific archival or secondary sources to support key causal
          links and tighten the timeline steps so each divergence feels more evidence
          based. Also simplify some slides to reduce cognitive load during delivery.

        Mirror which surfaces local narratives about climate adaptation in a neighborhood

        of printed contributions affected perceived permanence and trust. The reflection
        discusses the design choices and connects them to critical design principles

    - body: '<p>For my Participatory Workshop Plan I propose a three hour session
        titled Imagined Streets of 2045. The workshop aims to surface diverse perspectives
        on mobility equity by using a mix of card based scenario building, rapid prototyping
        with recyclable materials, and a collective mapping exercise. Learning objectives
        include enabling participants to articulate values that shape public space,
        practicing facilitation techniques that redistribute voice, and producing
        low fidelity artifacts that capture emergent preferences for future infrastructure.</p>

        <p>The workshop will begin with a brief warm up to build trust and attend
        to accessibility needs. Participants will be invited to share a brief memory
        of a street they care about, using one word prompts. Next small groups will
        be given persona cards and constraint cards that alter resources and governance,
        encouraging divergent futures. Each group will prototype a street fragment
        using cardboard, tape, and found objects. Facilitators will rotate, asking
        generative questions and noting power dynamics.</p>

        <p>In the mapping phase groups will place their artifacts on a shared map
        and annotate tradeoffs and tensions. The final ten minutes will be a collective
        reflection where participants vote on plausible interventions and suggest
        next steps for community engagement. Materials needed are printed persona
        and constraint decks, large paper maps, simple prototyping kits, sticky notes,
        and recording sheets. Spatial requirements include an open accessible room
        with movable seating and a quiet area for sensory breaks.</p>

        <p>Recruitment will target a mix of neighborhood residents, local planners,
        artists, and students to ensure multiple perspectives. Inclusion strategies
        include offering stipends, providing childcare and transit reimbursement,
        using plain language prompts, and offering materials in multiple languages.
        Evaluation will combine quick pre and post surveys on perceived agency and
        empathy, plus qualitative notes from facilitators and photographed artifacts
        as evidence of ideas generated.</p>

        <p>Ethical considerations center on avoiding extractive research practices.
        The plan includes explicit consent for use of artifacts and an offer to return
        insights to participants in a public report. Anticipated challenges include
        managing dominant voices and time pressure. Mitigation strategies include
        structured speaking turns, role rotation, and a visible timeline for activities.
        This workshop draws on participatory design principles and speculative methods
        to open space for collective imagination while attending to equity and care.

          actionable recommendations for stakeholders.

    - body: <p> This proposal outlines a time capsule concept designed for a neighborhood
        scale public futures project. The capsule is framed as a living archive that
        accepts contributions from diverse community members and invites periodic
        rituals of opening and recontextualizing. The concept narrative centers on
        practices of care and futuring rather than a single sealed object. Key elements
        include modular containers made from recycled metals and stabilized glass,
        a digital index that records provenance and contributor stories, and a climate
        aware storage strategy that reduces risk of moisture and contamination. The
        curation plan proposes rotating exhibits and cofacilitated workshops to surface
        narratives that are often excluded from official histories. For engagement
        we will partner with local libraries and community centers to host drop in
        sessions and participatory design labs. The speculative scenarios consider
        a near future in which the capsule is used as a pedagogical tool in schools
        and a longer term future in which materials are repurposed as part of civic
        repair during a major urban transformation. Ethical considerations address
        consent for inclusion and strategies for ongoing stewardship by community
        stewards. Overall the proposal blends practical conservation steps with critical
        reflection on what publics we imagine and who is entrusted with legacy making.

        as evaporative cooling, texture for airflow, absorbent surface, or embedded
        color change that responds to temperature. The hypothesis is that interacting
        with physical probes will surface unexpected user priorities and storytelling
        about urban heat and water. Method includes assembling a kit of four probes,
        recruiting twenty residents for short hands on sessions in a public plaza,
        observing interactions and collecting short interviews and ratings. Expected
        results include preferences for tactile cooling, comments about maintenance
        and aesthetics, and suggestions for where such strategies might fit into everyday

    - body: <p>The plaza had been renamed the Commons by committee vote two years
        ago, but the name did little to change what appeared at first glance. A canopy
        of soft sensors arced over the square, humming low when citizens gathered
        and going quiet when people dispersed. Mara carried the prototype in a canvas
        tote, a small matte device inscribed with a worn sticker from the community
        workshop. It could translate neighborhood rituals into adaptive lighting patterns
        and broadcast anonymous prompts that nudged passerby to share memories for
        a public archive. She placed it on the bench and the canopy brightened in
        a warm gradient, as if the plaza recognized intention. Around her, strangers
        paused, then began to speak. A child recited the recipe her grandmother once
        used to sweeten the winter market, an older man sketched a map of a vanished
        bus line in the dirt, and a young activist proposed a short list of rules
        for communal care. The device did not dictate outcomes. Instead it surfaced
        possibilities and amplified voices that might otherwise have been lost in
        the noise of urban schedules. By sunset there was a small paper trail of proposals
        pinned to the fountain and a consensus to petition the council for a pilot
        program. Mara left the Commons feeling uneasy and hopeful at once, aware that
        any tool that shaped public attention could also be repurposed. That tension
        was the work of design in public futures, a constant negotiation between intention,
        habit, and power.</p>

  - Applied speculative design methods for public futures
  pages:
  - body: 'This page describes the Speculative Policy Prototyping Workshop for Speculative
      Design for Public Futures 318

      The workshop goal is to practice design led approaches for imagining and testing
      policy interventions that respond to public challenges. Students will learn
      methods for rapid policy sketching, narrative prototyping, and low fidelity
      testing with community personas to surface unintended consequences and power
      dynamics.

      Format and schedule - Three live sessions plus an asynchronous sprint. Session
      1 - Framing constraints and norm mapping; Session 2 - Prototyping techniques
      and peer testing; Session 3 - Public feedback simulation and final pitches.
      Asynchronous work includes research, prototype development, and a reflective
      journal entry between sessions.

      Core activities - Rapid policy sketching and policy artifact creation; Scenario
      mapping and impact ladders; Persona based role play and tabletop testing; Creation
      of tangible engagement assets such as visual briefs, mock public notices, and
      short performative scripts to surface public responses.

      Deliverables and assessment - Team submission of two artifacts: a concise speculative
      policy brief and a prototype engagement asset. Assessment split includes peer
      feedback for 20 percent, instructor evaluation for 50 percent, and the reflective
      journal for 30 percent. Rubrics focus on plausibility, ethical reflection, clarity
      of public benefit, and attention to equity.

      Ethical guidance - Prototypes must avoid causing harm and must surface who benefits
      and who may be disadvantaged. Each submission needs a mitigation plan for potential
      harms and a plan for consent and data minimization when testing with people.

      Sample LMS discussion excerpt - Instructor - Please document key assumptions
      behind your prototypes and test them with at least two distinct community perspectives.
      Student A - We are prototyping a skills linked basic support policy and want
      feedback on how to make trade offs legible. Student B - Consider a pilot metric
      set that centers lived experience and access rather than only economic outputs.
      Instructor - Strong idea, draft a short evaluation plan before the next session
      for peer review.

      Support and logistics - Virtual office hours Thursdays 3 to 4 PM and by appointment.
      Upload draft artifacts to the workshop folder by Friday midnight to allow time
      for peer review and instructor comments.

    - body: '<p>In this Participatory Action Research Plan I propose a community focused
        project in a dense urban neighbourhood that explores barriers to equitable
        access to fresh produce and tests small scale interventions that can strengthen
        local food sovereignty. The plan begins by identifying research questions
        co created with community partners such as local gardeners, market vendors,
        and a neighbourhood food collective. Key questions include what structural
        and logistical challenges limit household access to fresh produce in this
        area and which community led strategies are most feasible to increase availability
        and use of produce from local urban farms.</p>

        <p>Stakeholder engagement is central to the design. I describe steps to recruit
        a community advisory group, hold listening sessions to refine research priorities,
        and use participatory mapping workshops to document food resources and gaps.
        All engagement activities emphasize reciprocity and shared decision making.
        Compensation for participants and clear agreements about data use are included
        to address power imbalances.</p>

        <p>Methods include mixed qualitative and quantitative approaches. Household
        surveys co designed with advisory members will capture consumption patterns
        and access barriers. Short ethnographic visits and photo voice exercises will
        provide contextual depth about daily food practices. Pilot interventions include
        a weekly mobile produce market managed by community members and a skills exchange
        program linking backyard growers with neighbours interested in container gardening.
        Evaluation combines pre and post measures of produce availability and household
        food security indicators with participant narratives about acceptability and
        sustainability.</p>

        <p>Ethical considerations cover informed consent, data sovereignty, and plans
        for sharing results in accessible formats. The plan specifies that raw data
        will be stored with the community organization and that reports and presentations
        will be co authored with community partners. A timeline outlines planning
        and recruitment in months one and two, baseline data collection in months
        three and four, intervention rollout in months five to eight, and evaluation
        and knowledge mobilization in months nine and ten.</p>

        <p>This approach draws on course concepts including agroecological principles
        of diversity and resilience, the role of local governance in food systems,
        and methods for community centered research. By centering lived experience
        and combining practical interventions with rigorous evaluation, the plan aims
        to produce both actionable improvements and transferable learning for other
        urban contexts.</p>'

    submissions:
    - body: '<p>During the previous growing season I participated in a neighborhood
        seed swap organized by a small community garden collective in an older part
        of the city. The event brought together a mix of long term residents migrant
        gardeners hobbyists and a few recent urban agriculture graduates. I came with
        packets of saved tomato and kale seed that I had dry stored from the prior
        year. Early in the afternoon I noticed a neighbor from a subsidized housing
        block arrive with several commercial seed packets bought at a major retailer
        and a stack of flyers from a seed company promoting hybrid varieties that
        promise uniform yields and predictable traits. Over the course of the swap
        I observed several dynamics that highlighted tensions around seed sovereignty.</p>

        <p>First I observed unequal access to diverse seed lines. The gardeners who
        had been saving seed for many years offered heirloom and regionally adapted
        varieties that showed resilience to local pests and fluctuating microclimate
        conditions. These varieties represented accumulated local knowledge and selection
        work done by gardeners over decades. In contrast newer participants tended
        to bring only a few commercial packets that contained modern hybrids. When
        a discussion began about seed reuse and the need to save seed across seasons
        some participants expressed surprise that saved seed was permissible and practical.
        This revealed gaps in knowledge and access to both seed saving techniques
        and to diverse genetic resources.</p>

        <p>Second I observed the influence of corporate narratives. The representative
        of the seed company circulated attractive marketing materials that emphasized
        convenience and guaranteed traits. Several attendees remarked that buying
        new packets each season seemed easier than investing time in learning seed
        saving. The company materials also obscured legal and technical constraints
        around saving seed for some patented or restricted hybrids. This created a
        subtle pressure toward dependence on purchased seed and away from communal
        custodianship.</p>

        <p>Third I noted the role of local governance and material infrastructure.
        The neighborhood lacked a formal seed library or storage facility and municipal
        rules about community events sometimes discouraged open exchanges that did
        not meet certain permitting criteria. One participant mentioned that transporting
        seed across the city could trigger concerns related to invasive species policies
        even when the seed was for common vegetables. These regulatory ambiguities
        complicate the simple act of sharing seed and privilege those with institutional
        knowledge or resources to navigate rules.</p>

        <p>Reflecting on the experience I see multiple layers where seed sovereignty
        is constrained and where it can be strengthened. On the constraint side there
        are structural issues such as corporate consolidation of seed markets intellectual
        property regimes and uneven access to knowledge and storage infrastructure.
        Socially there are power dynamics between long term gardeners and newcomers
        and between community groups and corporate actors. Ecologically the loss of
        locally adapted varieties reduces diversity and resilience in the urban agroecosystem.</p>

        <p>For constructive strategies I suggest establishing a community seed library
        with clear governance that emphasizes open access and documentation of provenance
        and growing conditions. Workshops that teach simple dry storage and selection
        techniques could reduce the knowledge gap. Building partnerships with local
        libraries or municipal community centers could help legitimize exchanges and
        streamline event permitting. Policy advocacy is also important for protecting
        the right to save and exchange seed and for clarifying local regulations so
        community groups are not inadvertently penalized. Finally creating reciprocal
        relationships between experienced seed stewards and newer gardeners can build
        trust and transfer knowledge.</p>

        <p>In terms of my own positionality I recognized that I benefit from a small
        urban balcony garden and internet access to open source seed networks which
        makes it relatively easy for me to access diverse seed. I also realized that
        I have a role to play in reducing information asymmetries by sharing techniques
        and by helping to organize infrastructure that supports community control
        over seed. Overall the seed swap illustrated that seed sovereignty is not
        only about genetics it is about local knowledge governance and access. Strengthening
        all of these dimensions will improve food security and resilience in urban
        agroecosystems.</p>

    - body: '<p>For this case study I worked with a 250 square foot corner lot next
        to a mixed use building. My site assessment noted full sun on the south side,
        dappled shade near the street trees, compacted topsoil in the center, and
        poor drainage along the eastern edge. I began with a simple soil improvement
        plan using sheet mulching and a series of organic amendments to rebuild structure
        and microbiology. To address runoff I designed a small bioswale along the
        eastern border connected to a rain barrel system that captures roof runoff
        for irrigation. Plant selection prioritized perennial vegetables and herbs
        for resilience, combined with annuals for seasonal yield and quick turnover.
        Key species include asparagus, chard, garlic, currants, rosemary, and a pollinator
        strip of native flowering plants to support beneficial insects. I arranged
        plantings in zones that reflect maintenance needs and water use, placing drought
        tolerant herbs near the street and water loving greens closer to the rain
        capture feature. My planting timeline staggers perennials in year one with
        successive annual successions to maintain production while perennials establish.
        I included a three year maintenance plan focused on mulching, targeted compost
        additions, and integrated pest management using habitat for predators and
        cultural controls. To estimate yields I used conservative per plant averages
        from local extension sources and projected a modest household supply that
        could supplement meals and provide surplus for a neighborhood gleaning effort.</p>

        <p>From an agroecological perspective the design emphasizes diversity to reduce
        pest pressure and enhance resilience, functional intercropping to use vertical
        space efficiently, and nutrient cycling through on site compost and mulch.
        The plan also integrates social dimensions by proposing volunteer days and
        a simple signage plan to build neighborhood stewardship and reduce conflicts
        over access. Challenges I encountered included balancing aesthetic expectations
        with edible productivity and negotiating space for long term perennials in
        a high demand urban site. If I repeat this project I would gather more community
        input early and include a small propagation area to supply replacement plants
        from cuttings. Overall the project shows how edible landscaping can convert
        marginal urban land into productive, biodiverse space while applying core
        principles of agroecology and supporting local food resilience.</p> '
      feedback:
        comment: Well organized submission that ties practical design decisions to
          agroecological theory. Your sketch and plant list were informative and the
          soil rebuilding plan is realistic. For a higher score include more precise
          yield calculations with sources, and a clearer timeline for volunteer training
          and seasonal tasks.

    - body: '<p>This water management plan outlines a practical approach for a 500
        square meter urban farm located in a temperate city climate. The plan starts
        with a simple water budget based on crop water requirements estimated from
        seasonal evapotranspiration and anticipated planting densities. Peak demand
        periods occur in midsummer and can be reduced by selecting suited crop varieties
        and adjusting planting schedules.</p>

        <p>Primary strategies include rainwater harvesting with rooftop and surface
        collection routed to a 10 000 liter cistern equipped with first flush diversion
        and filtration for irrigation use. Greywater reuse from washing stations is
        proposed for nonedible crop irrigation after basic treatment and monitoring.
        Drip irrigation lines combined with pressure compensating emitters are recommended
        to maximize irrigation efficiency and reduce evaporation losses. Soil focused
        practices include deep mulching using local green waste and incorporating
        compost to improve soil water retention and structure.</p>

        <p>Monitoring will use soil moisture sensors placed in representative beds
        at multiple depths and a simple rain gauge to track inputs. Irrigation scheduling
        will be demand driven based on sensor thresholds rather than fixed timers
        to avoid overwatering. A logbook will record irrigation volumes and weather
        events so adjustments can be made month to month.</p>

        <p>Conservation tactics also emphasize plant selection and design. Grouping
        crops by water needs and using shade structures for tender seedlings reduces
        transpiration stress. Incorporating native drought tolerant perennials along
        borders reduces overall landscape demand. Contingency measures for dry spells
        include temporary crop reduction and prioritizing high value crops.</p>

        <p>Evaluation metrics include total water used per square meter per season
        percent of irrigation supplied by harvested water crop yield per unit water
        and soil moisture trend lines across the growing season. An annual review
        will analyze these metrics and recommend investment priorities such as expanded
        storage improved filtration or automated sensor integration.</p>

        <p>Finally community engagement forms part of the plan. Training volunteers
        on efficient watering practices and promoting rain barrel adoption nearby
        reduces neighborhood demand pressures and increases resilience. Overall this
        integrated plan balances infrastructure investment with low cost cultural
        practices to reduce water use while maintaining productivity on a small urban
        farm.</p>

        on a community lot near campus The objective is to replace a patch of mown
        turf with native plant modules to support bees butterflies and other pollinators
        The hypothesis is that the planted modules will show higher pollinator visit
        rates and greater species richness within one growing season compared to the
        adjacent mown area

        The method includes site assessment soil preparation and installation of three
        2 by 3 meter planting modules with different native species mixes Each module
        will include at least four native forb species plus two structural shrubs
        to provide layered resources A shallow water feature bare ground patches and
        a small bundle of hollow stems will be added to provide nesting and drinking
        resources Monitoring will use weekly timed observations and fixed transect
        counts for 12 weeks plus a simple floral cover estimate and photographic records
        A short community workshop will be held to engage local volunteers in monitoring
        and maintenance

        Expected results include increased visit rates greater pollinator species
        richness and more sustained floral use through the season in the planted modules
        compared to mown turf The submission also includes a maintenance plan for

    - body: '<p>The evaluation examined a pilot community composting program operating
        in three adjacent urban neighborhoods. The program combined curbside pickup
        at selected sites drop off hubs and an on site demonstration garden. Methods
        included a review of program documents interviews with coordinators and participating
        residents a waste composition analysis of collected materials and simple soil
        tests at the demonstration garden. Participation rose steadily over the six
        month pilot with an average household diversion rate of 28 percent by weight.
        Contamination was present in roughly 12 percent of samples driven mainly by
        inclusion of non compostable plastics and food packaging. Compost quality
        met local guidelines for basic nutrient levels but showed variable maturity
        in early batches requiring extended curing time. Staff time and processing
        space were the main constraints observed while community engagement events
        improved proper sorting behavior among attendees. The report recommends clearer
        labeling at drop off sites expanded outreach to apartment residents improved
        sorting bins and a small investment in additional screening equipment. The
        findings suggest that with targeted operational changes the program can scale
        to serve a larger share of the ward and provide tangible benefits for urban
        soil health and local food production.</p>

        To work around this start pilot projects with willing landlords and community

      must complete the new online safety module and attend a hands on orientation
      session with the lab manager. PPE including lab coat eye protection and closed
      toe shoes is mandatory at all times. Access will be granted via keycard after
      training is completed and documented in the LMS. Starting next Monday capacity
      limits will be in place and walk in access will no longer be allowed. To schedule
      an orientation or ask about exemptions contact the lab manager Erica Shaw or

    - body: '<p> In this case study I examine bismuth telluride based alloys as a
        model thermoelectric material for near room temperature applications. The
        analysis begins with the key transport parameters that govern thermoelectric
        performance. The Seebeck coefficient drives the open circuit voltage per unit
        temperature difference while electrical conductivity determines power output.
        Thermal conductivity acts to short circuit the temperature gradient so reduction
        of lattice thermal conductivity is a central design goal. The dimensionless
        figure of merit ZT combines these factors and provides a metric for material
        optimization. </p>

        <p> I review approaches to enhance ZT through nanostructuring. Quantum confinement
        can increase the density of electronic states near the Fermi level and boost
        the Seebeck coefficient for given carrier concentrations. Concurrently, nanoscale
        interfaces and embedded nanoprecipitates increase phonon scattering and decrease
        lattice thermal conductivity without severely degrading electrical conductivity.
        Grain boundary engineering and superlattice architectures are contrasted in
        terms of their impact on charge carrier transport and phonon mean free path.
        </p>

        <p> For experimental considerations I describe the Harman method and the four
        probe technique for simultaneous measurement of Seebeck coefficient electrical
        resistivity and thermal conductivity in bulk samples. I highlight potential
        sources of systematic error and suggest best practices for sample preparation
        contact quality and thermal anchoring to ensure reliable results. The role
        of carrier concentration tuning via doping or stoichiometry adjustments is
        discussed together with trade offs between mobility and Seebeck coefficient.
        </p>

        <p> Finally I connect material level improvements to device level metrics.
        Module efficiency depends on both material ZT and module design such as leg
        geometry and contact resistance. Practical applications include waste heat
        recovery in electronics and small scale cooling. I conclude with an outlook
        on opportunities in 2D materials and topological insulators where unconventional
        electronic structure may enable new design pathways for high performance thermoelectrics.

    - body: '<p> Defect engineering is central to tuning the electrical and optical
        properties of semiconductor materials In this essay I discuss several classes
        of defects that commonly appear in crystalline semiconductors and how they
        alter carrier dynamics and recombination processes I describe experimental
        techniques used to identify and quantify defects and consider strategies used
        to mitigate adverse effects while exploiting beneficial ones </p>

        <p> Point defects such as vacancies interstitials and substitutional impurities
        create localized states within the band gap that can act as traps or recombination
        centers These centers reduce carrier lifetime and mobility in devices such
        as solar cells and transistors Controlled introduction of dopants can however
        be used to tailor carrier concentration and improve contact properties The
        balance between intentional doping and unintentional defect formation is a
        key aspect of defect engineering </p>

        <p> Extended defects including dislocations stacking faults and grain boundaries
        often serve as nonradiative recombination sites in optoelectronic materials
        Grain boundary passivation and strain management are common approaches to
        reduce the negative impact of these defects Techniques such as annealing and
        rapid thermal processing are used to repair damage and redistribute impurities
        after ion implantation which is a primary method of introducing dopants for
        device fabrication </p>

        <p> Characterization techniques provide complementary information about defect
        type and density Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals atomic
        structure and extended defects while scanning tunneling microscopy maps local
        electronic states Deep level transient spectroscopy measures electrically
        active defect levels and photoluminescence gives insight into radiative and
        nonradiative recombination channels Combining these methods yields a coherent
        picture that guides process optimization </p>

        <p> In a recent lab project I analyzed silicon samples that had undergone
        different annealing schedules Samples processed at higher temperatures showed
        reduced trap densities and longer carrier lifetimes as measured by time resolved
        photoluminescence This supported the idea that vacancy complexes can be passivated
        by thermal processes but also highlighted the trade off with diffusion of
        dopants that can blur junction profiles </p>

        <p> Defect engineering therefore requires an integrated view that spans processing
        characterization and device testing By understanding defect energetics and
        kinetics engineers can design processes that enhance desirable properties
        while minimizing harmful effects Careful measurement and iteration remain
        essential for progress in semiconductor device performance </p>

    - body: '<p> I propose a magnetic tunnel junction device optimized for low energy
        switching and high thermal stability for non volatile memory and logic demonstrations.
        The design centers on a perpendicularly magnetized CoFeB free layer coupled
        to an MgO tunnel barrier and a synthetic antiferromagnetic reference layer.
        To reduce write energy and improve scalability I plan to integrate a heavy
        metal underlayer such as platinum to enable spin orbit torque switching as
        a complementary mechanism to spin transfer torque. The proposal will explain
        the underlying spin dependent transport processes and how interfacial anisotropy
        and damping influence switching thresholds and retention.

        The experimental plan covers thin film growth using magnetron sputtering with
        in situ oxidation control for the tunnel barrier. I will detail target layer
        thicknesses and expected optimization routes such as post deposition annealing
        to enhance MgO crystallinity and tunneling magnetoresistance. Nanofabrication
        steps include electron beam lithography to define sub 100 nanometer pillars
        and ion milling to pattern the stack. Test structures will include patterned
        devices and blanket films for structural and magnetic characterization.

        Characterization methods will include electrical measurements to extract resistance
        versus field loops and switching statistics, four point probing to minimize
        contact resistance effects, and pulsed current measurements to determine switching
        time and critical current density. I will use ferromagnetic resonance and
        spin torque ferromagnetic resonance to measure damping and torque efficiencies.
        Microscopy methods such as transmission electron microscopy and x ray reflectivity
        will assess interface quality and layer thickness control.

        I will address common nanoscale challenges such as edge damage from patterning
        variability interlayer diffusion and thermal stability. Mitigation strategies
        will include optimized etch recipes protective hard masks and controlled annealing
        schedules. Scalability and integration will be discussed with attention to
        back end of line compatibility and interconnect considerations.

        The proposal includes a timeline a list of required equipment and consumables
        and a risk mitigation plan with alternative material systems such as Heusler
        alloys or ferrimagnetic layers if initial stacks fail to meet spin polarization
        targets. I will support the design and experimental choices with peer reviewed
        literature and include a section on expected outcomes and criteria for success.
        Connections to course topics such as quantum transport nanoscale interfaces
        and material dependent spin phenomena will be highlighted to demonstrate the
        synthesis of concepts from lectures and labs. </p>'

    - body: '<p>The proposed nanofabrication process begins with wafer selection and
        cleaning to remove organic and particulate contamination. Standard cleaning
        uses solvent degrease followed by a dilute RCA style clean and a final deionized
        rinse. Next the process moves to thermal oxidation or gate dielectric deposition
        depending on the device architecture. Key parameters at this stage include
        temperature ramp rates and oxide thickness uniformity. After dielectric formation
        a resist spin coat and soft bake are performed with attention to resist thickness
        and edge bead removal.</p>


        <p>Electron beam or deep ultraviolet lithography is used to define the nanowire
        pattern. Critical exposure dose and focus must be optimized to achieve the
        target line width. Pattern transfer is achieved by reactive ion etching with
        chemistry chosen for selectivity between the resist and substrate. Etch rate
        control and sidewall profile are monitored with inline metrology such as SEM
        and ellipsometry. After etch a resist strip and surface passivation step are
        applied to reduce surface states that degrade device performance.</p>


        <p>Metal contact formation uses a lift off or subtractive metal etch approach.
        Deposition parameters such as base pressure and deposition rate are controlled
        to minimize film stress and grain boundary scattering. Annealing steps are
        specified with temperature and duration to form low resistance contacts while
        avoiding diffusion into critical regions. Final steps include dielectric encapsulation
        and access via via etch followed by metrology checks for critical dimensions
        and electrical testing at wafer level.</p>


        <p>Throughout the flow contamination control is enforced by cleanroom practices
        PPE and use of filtered process gases. Inline process control points are identified
        for yield limiting steps and include statistical process control for critical
        dimensions and contact resistance. Typical failure modes are resist scumming
        improper etch selectivity and particle induced opens. A conservative timeline
        for a single iteration from mask design to first electrical test is three
        to four weeks in a well equipped facility. Expected yield for a single small
        run depends on feature density and process maturity but a reasonable target
        for a first pass is 50 percent functional devices with improvements expected
        after two to three optimization cycles.</p>


        <p>References and detailed parameter tables are included in the full report
        submitted as an appendix. The submission highlights safety considerations
        for chemical handling and vacuum tool operation and a brief risk assessment
        for common process excursions.</p>

      focused ion beam atomic layer deposition and dry etching for device patterning

      Characterization techniques covered include angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy
      scanning tunneling microscopy quantum transport measurements and transmission
      electron microscopy with attention to sample preparation and cryogenic measurement
      methods

      Lab and cleanroom best practices are described with guidance on contamination
      control glove use hazardous material handling and reproducibility in nanofabrication

      Applications such as fault tolerant qubits topological spintronics and low dissipation
      electronics are discussed along with current challenges like disorder induced
      localization and interfacing topological materials with superconductors

      Students are expected to engage with recent literature bring design proposals

        The model accepts stellar spectrum analogs planet mass radius and orbital
        distance as inputs and outputs equilibrium surface temperature estimates atmospheric
        column water content and an index representing chemical stability based on
        combined temperature and redox proxy parameters I implemented the code in

        <p>The report documents the model derivation starting from energy balance
        equations through parameterizations for greenhouse forcing and volatile loss
        The sensitivity analysis varies stellar luminosity atmospheric composition
        and planetary albedo across ranges motivated by observed exoplanet populations
        and solar system analogs Results highlight regimes where small changes in
        stellar flux or atmospheric composition produce large shifts in surface temperature
        which in turn strongly influence the chemical stability index The simulation
        figures include two dimensional contour maps of habitability index versus
        orbital distance and atmospheric greenhouse strength as well as time series

        <p>I included a code archive with a clear README that explains dependencies
        how to reproduce the main figures and where to find the notebooks used for
        analysis The README also documents test cases and provides a short troubleshooting
        guide I reflect on model limitations in the report noting that the one dimensional
        approach omits atmospheric dynamics and spatial heterogeneity and that the
        chemical proxy is simplified pending more detailed reaction network work I
        also suggest observational strategies that would help constrain the most sensitive

    submissions:
    - body: '<p>In this case study I examine a notional mission to Enceladus that
        returns plume samples to Earth for detailed analysis. The core ethical tensions
        center on protecting potential native ecosystems, safeguarding Earth from
        unknown biological agents, and balancing scientific knowledge gains against
        precautionary limits on exploration. First I evaluate planetary protection.
        Current international guidance emphasizes minimizing forward contamination
        to preserve the integrity of biosignature detection. For an Enceladus mission
        this would imply stringent sterilization of spacecraft components and cautious
        sample handling protocols. Ethically this obligation can be framed as a duty
        to avoid harming non terrestrial life or precluding its study by introducing
        terrestrial organisms that could out compete or obscure indigenous biology.</p>

        <p>Second I consider backward contamination risks. Returning samples to Earth
        raises questions about acceptable levels of risk to human and environmental
        health. A precautionary approach supports containment and multiple redundant
        biosafety barriers during transit, quarantine, and analysis. This approach
        must be weighed against scientific imperatives for timely and open investigation.
        Ethically robust policy will require transparent risk assessments, independent
        review by multidisciplinary panels, and clear plans for containment failure
        scenarios.</p>

        <p>Third I discuss standards for declaring a life detection claim. False positives
        could arise from contamination, abiotic chemistry, or instrument artifacts.
        Ethical reporting demands rigorous chains of custody, reproducible lines of
        evidence across independent methods, and conservative language in public communication.
        The scientific community has a responsibility to avoid sensational claims
        that might mislead the public or provoke premature policy responses.</p>

        <p>Fourth I analyze stakeholder responsibilities. Mission designers, funding
        agencies, national space authorities, and the international community share
        duties to align mission goals with planetary protection norms. Because outer
        planet exploration affects all humanity, decision making should include international
        consultation and mechanisms for dispute resolution. Indigenous or local community
        concerns are less directly implicated for Enceladus than for Earth based fieldwork,
        but global equity questions remain about who benefits from discoveries and
        who bears risks.</p>

        <p>Finally I consider governance and ethical frameworks. COSPAR guidelines
        and national regulations provide a starting point but may not fully cover
        sample return scenarios from ocean worlds. I argue for adaptive governance
        that combines precaution, proportionality, and deliberative engagement. Practical
        steps include independent ethical review boards for mission approval, staged
        missions that escalate sample handling complexity only after risk reduction,
        and commitments to data sharing and scientific reproducibility.</p>

        <p>In conclusion, ethical exploration of life detection missions requires
        integrating planetary protection, rigorous scientific standards, transparent
        risk governance, and international cooperation. Balancing the pursuit of transformative
        knowledge with obligations to protect unfamiliar ecosystems and Earth demands
        conservative operational choices, robust oversight, and clear communication
        pathways.</p>

    - body: '<p>During the field exercise at the inland dune system used as a Mars
        analog I focused on identifying aeolian and episodic fluvial signatures and
        relating these to potential habitability niches The site exhibits active dune
        migration, accumulation benches, and preserved interdune microtopography I
        used a handheld GPS to record sketch map control points a clinometer to estimate
        slope angles and a small sieve set to collect grain size samples from windward
        and lee faces</p>

        <p>Mapping units were defined by surface texture and form Unit A comprises
        active crescentic dunes with fine to medium sand Unit B includes damp interdune
        depressions with mixed fines Unit C is a relict sand sheet with a denser crust
        and dust coatings I noted sorted surface stones and occasional lag concentrates
        that suggest episodic deflation and sorting processes Mapping contacts emphasized
        erosional escarpments and depositional lee slopes</p>

        <p>Observations of ripple morphology and grain size contrast indicate prevailing
        wind transport with episodic stronger events that move coarse fractions During
        rare runoff tests a shallow ephemeral channel formed and carried suspended
        fines to interdune hollows These hollows are potential transient water collectors
        that could provide short lived wet environments and subsurface moisture retention
        both relevant to habitability</p>

        <p>Sketches included cross sections showing shallow layering interpreted as
        successive depositional events with occasional thin crusts that may preserve
        organics by reducing radiation exposure at the immediate surface The mapping
        exercise links geomorphic indicators to environmental stability and resource
        availability For example interdune hollows with fine sediments and reduced
        insolation are candidates for microbial refugia if liquid water were available</p>

        <p>Methodologically I combined field notes with drone imagery to refine unit
        boundaries and produced a process map that highlights sediment sources transport
        pathways sinks and transient wetting zones The exercise emphasized the need
        for multi scale observations to infer processes from landforms For planetary
        analog studies this approach supports selection of landing sites and sampling
        targets that maximize chances of detecting biosignatures</p>

        <p>In conclusion the mapping shows a dynamic aeolian dominated landscape punctuated
        by episodic water influence that creates transient habitable conditions The
        integration of field mapping granulometry and imagery provides a robust basis
        for interpreting surface processes and assessing habitability potential in
        similar planetary settings</p> '

    - body: '<p> This submission summarizes a 2021 study that examined how microbial
        mats and organic microstructures are preserved within fine grained siliciclastic
        sediments under varying redox and burial conditions. The authors combined
        field sampling from a coastal tidal flat with laboratory experiments simulating
        early diagenesis and used a suite of microscopy, organic geochemical, and
        mineralogical analyses to trace preservation pathways. They found that rapid
        mineral precipitation around organic tissues and early cementation were key
        to retaining fine morphological detail, while anoxic pore waters limited oxidative
        degradation of organic molecules. Molecular proxies such as specific hopanoid
        derivatives and kerogen structural indices correlated with microfossil preservation,
        supporting a link between early diagenetic mineralogy and chemical biosignature
        retention. The paper discusses how sedimentation rate, microbial community
        composition, and early diagenetic mineral phases interact to control what
        is ultimately preserved in the rock record. Implications include refining
        target lithologies for biosignature hunting on Mars and improving sampling
        strategies to capture both morphological and molecular evidence. The authors
        note limitations related to taphonomic overprinting during deep burial and
        suggest complementary in situ analyses during field campaigns. </p> '

  - Field methods for assessing planetary habitability
  pages:
  - body: 'Astrobiology combines field based investigation with laboratory analysis
      to evaluate the potential for life in planetary environments. Field methods
      emphasize careful site selection, sterile sampling, in situ measurement, and
      comprehensive metadata collection. Instruments range from handheld spectrometers
      and microscopes to drilling rigs and environmental sensors required for geochemical
      profiling and biosignature detection. Strict contamination control and planetary
      protection protocols preserve sample integrity and prevent forward contamination.
      Results are validated through reproducible workflows, cross disciplined collaboration,
      and peer reviewed publication to separate robust evidence from speculation.
      Mastery of these techniques allows students to assess habitability using observational
      constraints, thermodynamic limits, and ecological analogs on Earth

    - body: '<p>In this assignment I focus on acoustic communication in a chorus of
        tree frogs and use signal detection theory to interpret both sender and receiver
        strategies. During nocturnal surveys I observed that males increase call amplitude
        and rate when chorus density rises yet many calls overlap creating ambiguous
        signals for females. Framing this with signal detection theory clarifies the
        trade off faced by a receiver female: lowering the detection threshold increases
        the probability of correctly identifying a calling male but also raises the
        false alarm rate due to ambient noise and overlapping calls. Conversely raising
        the threshold reduces false alarms but risks missing potential mates.</p>

        <p>To illustrate I present a simple numeric example. Suppose male call amplitudes
        follow a distribution with mean 72 dB and noise has mean 62 dB with overlapping
        variance. If a receiver adopts a threshold at 67 dB the hit probability can
        be estimated from the tail of the male distribution while the false alarm
        probability comes from the tail of the noise distribution. Adjusting the threshold
        by a few decibels shifts these probabilities and can be evaluated by computing
        expected fitness payoffs for hits versus false alarms. If the fitness cost
        of a missed mating opportunity is high relative to the cost of responding
        to a false alarm the optimal threshold will be lower. In dense choruses however
        the increase in false alarms may change payoff ratios and push optimal thresholds
        upward.</p>

        <p>I also consider how environmental factors such as wind and insect noise
        alter the underlying distributions and therefore the adaptive landscape for
        decision rules. This leads to predictions about plasticity in receiver thresholds
        and plastic adjustments in signal amplitude and timing by senders. Finally
        I connect these behavioral patterns to neuroethological mechanisms. Peripheral
        auditory filtering and short term adaptation can reduce the impact of continuous
        background noise while central circuits can implement variable decision thresholds

    - body: '<p>This synthesis examines three recent studies that link neural activity
        to

        natural behavior across species, with the aim of identifying convergent

        insights and open questions for computational neuroethology. The selected

        papers use distinct experimental systems and methods but together illustrate

        common challenges in mapping neural dynamics to behavior and in building

        predictive models.</p>


        <p>Paper one uses high density electrophysiology in freely moving rodents
        to

        probe neural correlates of exploratory decisions. The authors combine long

        term multi site recordings with automated pose tracking to relate population

        activity in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus to choices during a spatial

        foraging task. Key findings include reproducible low dimensional trajectories

        that anticipate choice points, and trial to trial modulation of these

        trajectories by recent rewards. The methods emphasize careful behavioral

        tracking, dimensionality reduction, and cross validated decoding. A strength

        of this study is the integration of continuous behavior with rich neural

        time series. Limitations include modest causal perturbation and a focus on
        a

        restricted set of task conditions which may limit generality to other

        contexts.</p>


        <p>Paper two studies sensorimotor transformations in flying insects using

        tethered virtual reality together with intracellular and calcium imaging.

        Here the authors manipulate visual flow and measure motor output and neural

        responses in descending interneurons. They show that specific interneurons

        encode optic flow features and that the motor commands instantiated are

        nonlinear functions of sensory history. The combination of precise sensory

        control and cellular resolution measurements reveals mechanistic details of

        sensory encoding and immediate motor mapping. However, tethering and

        simplified sensory scenes reduce ethological complexity, and it is unclear

        how observed computations scale to free flight with richer multimodal cues.</p>


        <p>Paper three employs pose estimation and unsupervised behavior clustering
        in

        fish larvae combined with whole brain calcium imaging at single cell

        resolution. Using correlation based network analyses and perturbations by

        optogenetic stimulation the authors identify distributed ensembles whose

        activity predicts transitions between discrete behavior motifs. This work

        highlights the benefits of combining comprehensive brain imaging with

        automated behavior segmentation. A limitation lies in the coarse temporal

        resolution of calcium signals relative to spiking and in challenges of

        inferring causality from correlational ensemble activity despite targeted

        perturbations.</p>


        <p>Comparing the studies reveals trade offs between ecological validity,

        measurement resolution, and experimental control. Rodent electrophysiology

        offers millisecond scale temporal fidelity in naturalistic behavior but

        typically samples a fraction of the network. Whole brain calcium imaging

        yields coverage but blurs timing and may miss rapid spiking dynamics. Tethered

        virtual reality permits precise stimulus control and perturbation but alters

        natural sensory flows and motor feedback. Analytically, all three studies

        use dimensionality reduction or clustering to reduce behavioral and neural

        complexity, yet differ in the interpretability of low dimensional axes and

        in how they validate inferred variables against behavior or perturbations.</p>


        <p>To reconcile differences and extend these approaches I propose a hybrid

        experiment in an intermediate sized vertebrate such as a small bird or

        lizard where wireless multichannel electrophysiology can be combined with

        high frame rate video tracking and a lightweight inertial sensor package.

        The experimental design would include naturalistic foraging sequences and
        a

        set of controlled sensory perturbations delivered in free behavior. Analytically

        I recommend aligning population neural trajectories to behaviorally defined

        motifs using manifold alignment methods, and applying causal discovery

        techniques that combine targeted optogenetic or electrical perturbations with

        time resolved decoding. Specific hypotheses to test include whether

        low dimensional trajectories identified in freely moving mammals generalize

        across taxa and whether perturbations of trajectory phase produce predictable

        shifts in upcoming behavior. Quantitatively, modeling should integrate

        latent dynamical systems with state dependent observation models that

        account for calcium or spiking measurement differences.</p>


        <p>In conclusion, these three papers collectively advance how we link neural

        dynamics to natural behavior by combining detailed measurements, computational

        analysis, and targeted manipulations. Moving forward, hybrid experiments that

        balance coverage, temporal precision, and ecological validity, together with

        robust causal tests and unified modeling frameworks, will help build more

        generalizable theories of how neural circuits generate behavior across

        species.</p>

    - body: ' <p> For this lab I annotated a six minute video of foraging rodents
        in a semi natural arena. I first watched the clip once to get a sense of common
        behaviors. I then developed an ethogram with seven behaviors including rearing
        standing still grooming digging social approach following and feeding. Operational
        definitions were kept simple to maximize inter coder agreement For example
        I defined rearing as both front paws leaving the ground and vertical body
        angle of greater than 45 degrees I used the video player frame counter to
        record start and end times for each bout and logged events in a spreadsheet
        Then I computed total counts mean bout durations and percent time spent in
        each behavior The most frequent behavior was foraging followed by grooming
        Social interactions were rare and often brief I noted several ambiguous events
        where two behaviors overlapped for instance feeding while being groomed To
        handle overlaps I recorded primary behavior as the one that required active
        movement and secondary behavior in a separate column This rule increased consistency
        across the annotated segments I also reflected on sources of error including
        brief occlusions by arena walls and low contrast in low light segments To
        improve future coding I recommend standardizing pre annotation playback and
        using short trial practice sessions with a rubric I also discuss computational
        assistance Tracking based on centroid detection could reduce manual timing
        errors and pose estimation would help disambiguate grooming from feeding by
        revealing limb motion patterns Automated detection would also allow calculation
        of more complex metrics such as proximity networks and approach velocity which
        are hard to estimate by eye Overall the manual annotation gave insight into

  - body: 'Understanding how neural circuits generate natural behavior is a core concern
      of Computational Neuroethology and Animal Behavior 477. This page summarizes
      experimental and computational strategies for linking neurons and networks to
      ethologically relevant actions. Topics include in vivo electrophysiology, calcium
      imaging, targeted perturbations using optogenetics and chemogenetics, and anatomical
      mapping with modern connectomic approaches. We emphasize studying behavior in
      naturalistic contexts, extracting kinematic and pose features with automated
      tracking, and building dynamical models that predict decision making and motor
      sequences. Practical modules will cover preprocessing of neural and behavioral
      data, model fitting, cross validation, and interpretation of circuit level mechanisms.
      The page also addresses reproducibility, data sharing, and ethical considerations
      for research with live animals to promote rigorous and responsible science.

    - body: <p>During a simulated alarm in the antiquities wing I proposed a multi
        phase emergency response that uses a mobile robot to assess hazards protect
        vulnerable collections and provide real time information to first responders.
        The plan begins with a rapid entry phase where the robot uses thermal and
        humidity sensors together with a wide angle camera to map the immediate environment
        without contacting objects. Next the robot executes a perimeter sweep to identify
        structural risks and any sources of smoke or water. The design prioritizes
        non contact methods to preserve fragile surfaces and coatings.</p><p>Sensor
        selection focuses on redundancy and museum safe operation. A low power LIDAR
        supports short range SLAM in cluttered gallery spaces while a stereo camera
        pair provides visual inspection and documentation. Environmental sensors measure
        particulate levels and relative humidity to detect threats to paper and textile
        collections. The robot is configured to maintain a safe standoff distance
        and to use soft bumpers and velocity limits to avoid accidental collisions.</p><p>Autonomy
        is tiered to balance speed and oversight. In the first minutes the robot follows
        a pre approved autonomous route to collect situational data and then switches
        to supervised autonomy for targeted tasks such as placing a visual marker
        near a priority object or relaying a live feed to the emergency coordinator.
        This hybrid approach allows rapid situational awareness while keeping a human
        in the loop for conservation critical decisions.</p><p>Conservation safeguards
        are embedded in mission rules. The robot will not manipulate objects unless
        explicit permission is provided by a conservator and will use non invasive
        imaging techniques for condition assessment. All operations log metadata including
        timestamps location and sensor readings to support post incident analysis
        and chain of custody for any evidence or condition reports. A clear handoff
        protocol ensures that when humans enter the scene the robot yields space and
        provides compiled data to support safe recovery of artifacts.</p><p>Risk assessment
        covers both robot induced risk and environmental threats. Failure modes include
        sensor occlusion navigation errors and communication loss. Mitigations include
        redundant sensing conservative motion planning safe fallback behaviors and
        a return to base routine if communications drop. The plan ties directly to
        course concepts such as SLAM in constrained interiors end effector design
        for non contact inspection system level safety and ethical considerations
        for operating around sensitive cultural heritage.</p>

        mid sized exhibition gallery that houses mixed media artifacts. The design
        uses a distributed sensor network with high accuracy temperature sensors capacitive
        humidity probes and light meters positioned to capture spatial gradients.
        Actuators include low flow HVAC dampers localized humidifiers and LED lighting
        drivers controlled via a central edge node. For control I implemented a hierarchical
        strategy combining model predictive control at the room scale and a cascade
        PID loop for local actuators to respond to fast disturbances.</p>

        <p>To validate the design I ran a simulation using historical environmental
        data and injected typical visitor heat loads. Results show the system maintains
        temperature within plus or minus 0.5 degrees C and relative humidity within
        plus or minus 3 percent while reducing overall HVAC energy use by an estimated
        18 percent compared to a fixed schedule. I include a calibration plan for
        sensors periodic verification intervals and a data quality pipeline to detect
        sensor drift and outliers.</p>

        and provides secondary support to stabilize the shard during transport. I
        describe a simple communication handshake that confirms grip quality and positional
        tolerance before any motion begins. Safety checks include sensor based force
        limits, collision avoidance with shelving, and an emergency release procedure
        that returns the shard to a padded tray. The tutorial also includes a sample
        state machine for task sequencing, a discussion of latency tolerant messaging,
        and recommended logging to record handling events for conservation records.

    - body: <p>In the recent project I evaluated three non destructive testing methods
        for a bronze statuette prone to surface corrosion and subsurface casting voids.
        I used visual inspection augmented by raking light to document surface condition
        followed by handheld ultrasonic pulse echo to map internal discontinuities
        and infrared thermography to detect shallow subsurface delamination and varying
        material density. For the ultrasonic test I adjusted gain and pulse repetition
        to balance signal clarity and noise while noting the coupling medium and probe
        frequency used. Thermography scans were performed with active heating using
        a controlled lamp array and I recorded thermal transient curves for regions
        of interest. Each method offered specific strengths and limits in resolution
        penetration depth and sensitivity to material heterogeneity. Combining results
        allowed me to form a more complete hypothesis about the statuette internal
        structure than any single method would provide. For future work I would include
        radiography for higher resolution of metal inclusions and establish a protocol
        for quantifying uncertainty in layer thickness estimates. Overall the blended
        approach improved diagnostic confidence while maintaining artifact safety
        through careful exposure control and handling procedures. </p>
      feedback:

          safety steps. For full marks include quantified limits of detection discuss
          measurement uncertainty and attach raw data files or annotated images. Consider

    - body: '<p>During this project I designed a soft pneumatic gripper intended for
        lifting and

        repositioning delicate woven textiles during conservation treatments. The
        primary

        goals were to minimize contact pressure, conform to varying surface geometry,

        and provide fine force control to avoid stress on fibers. I selected a platinum

        cured silicone elastomer for the actuator skins because it offers a combination

        of low modulus, good tear resistance, and chemical inertness compared with
        other

        silicones. The internal chambers were patterned with thin inextensible fabric

        layers to constrain expansion and convert inflation into bending that produces
        a

        gentle wrap around the textile edge.</p>


        <p>For actuation I used low pressure pneumatic bladders driven by a proportional

        valve and a compact air reservoir. This approach allows smooth force application

        and rapid deflation for release. To measure contact and ensure safe handling
        I

        integrated thin film force sensors at the inner faces and a soft capacitive
        pad to

        detect presence and distribution of contact. Sensor readings feed a closed
        loop

        controller that modulates inflation pressure to keep contact force below conservative

        thresholds derived from consultation with practicing textile conservators.
        Safety

        layers include a hardware pressure relief valve and an emergency deflate command

        that can be triggered by either the operator or an automatic anomaly detector.</p>


        <p>Control was implemented with a microcontroller running a hybrid scheme
        that

        combines a PID loop for pressure regulation with a higher level state machine

        responsible for task sequencing. During trials I calibrated the mapping between

        sensor signals and applied force using a series of bench tests with calibrated

        loads and surrogate textile coupons. Validation involved repeated pick and
        place

        tasks with graded fragility samples, measurement of peak contact pressures,
        and

        post handling textile inspection under magnification to detect any fiber displacement

        or abrasion. The design met the target of maintaining contact pressure under
        the

        accepted limit for fragile linen samples and achieved repeatable gentle grasps

        without slippage.</p>


        <p>Reflecting on improvements, I would explore softer silicone blends and
        integrated

        distributed tactile sensing to better detect shear forces. I also recommend
        a user

        interface that guides conservators through safe grasp presets and documents
        handling

        events for provenance records. Collaborating early and iteratively with conservators

        was essential to define acceptable force envelopes and handling protocols
        and should

        remain central to future development.</p>

  - Robotic Manipulation for Artifact Conservation
  pages:
  - body: 'Robotic systems for artifact preservation combine precision engineering
      with conservation science to support the long term care of museum collections.
      They encompass autonomous mobile platforms for continuous environmental monitoring,
      compliant robotic arms for delicate handling and localized treatments, and non
      contact imaging such as 3D scanning and multispectral photography for condition
      assessment. These tools improve repeatability of inspections, reduce physical
      risk to fragile objects, and enable interventions in confined or hazardous areas
      while preserving human oversight. Effective use depends on close collaboration
      between conservators, curators, and engineers to ensure mechanical actions respect
      material sensitivity and historical context. The course emphasizes validation,
      ethical practice, and documentation so that robotic interventions are reversible,
      minimally invasive, and fully recorded. Topics include sensor fusion, compliant
      control strategies, data management for long term monitoring, and case studies
      demonstrating successful robotic conservation projects

    - body: <p>In the first scene I examine a moment from a narrative driven adventure
        title where the player explores an abandoned audio studio. Diegetic elements
        include the hum of old equipment footsteps on worn floorboards and the distant
        sound of a malfunctional speaker. Non diegetic elements include a low ambient
        pad that swells to cue tension and a narrator style voiceover that provides
        context. The diegetic sounds ground the player in the environment and invite
        investigation while the non diegetic pad and voiceover shape emotion and guide
        pacing. Because the player can choose how long to linger in the room the non
        diegetic pad is implemented with adaptive layers that fade in after a threshold
        time to avoid cutting player agency.</p><p>In the second scene I analyze a
        branching story game where a character performs a ritual. Diegetic sounds
        are ritual instruments chanting and the ritual space reverb. Non diegetic
        elements are musical motifs tied to the character arc and a cinematic swell
        that underscores key branching choices. Interactivity alters the timing and
        intensity of the swell by mapping musical stems to player choice flags so
        that each branch blends different stems for continuity. This preserves diegetic
        plausibility while allowing non diegetic music to reflect player agency.</p><p>Linking
        to course concepts the analysis highlights how audio affordances signal actionable
        objects and how source attribution affects player belief. Spatialization and
        occlusion models help maintain diegetic realism so that players do not mistake
        environmental cues for scoring music. From an implementation perspective adaptive
        middleware states and parameter driven mixing are crucial. For example using
        exposed RTPCs to modulate reverb send levels and music stem volumes keeps
        transitions smooth as the player moves between states. One proposed modification
        for the studio scene is to route the narrator lines through an in world device
        so that they can be toggled by interacting with a console. This preserves
        the guiding function of the voiceover while making it diegetic and giving
        the player an explicit control that reinforces immersion.</p>

    - body: '<p> In my recent project for an interactive narrative set in a forest
        environment I experimented with two spatialization techniques for placing
        sound in the virtual scene namely binaural rendering and ambisonic panning
        I will describe how I implemented each method the challenges I encountered
        and the effect each had on player perception and storytelling </p>

        <p> Binaural rendering was used for close up sounds that relate directly to
        character focus It allowed precise localization by simulating ear cues This
        technique enhanced moments of intimacy and tension for example a nearby rustle
        felt immediate and unnerving Implementing binaural audio required head related
        transfer functions and careful management of dry and reverberant components
        I found that desktop listening with headphones preserved spatial cues best
        but required optimization to avoid phase artifacts especially when mixing
        multiple sources </p>

        <p> Ambisonic panning was applied to ambient layers and distant events This
        method provided a smooth enveloping field that supported narrative context
        without drawing attention away from focal elements It scaled well for scenes
        that needed a consistent atmosphere across different playback setups Integrating
        ambisonics into the engine demanded decoding to the appropriate order and
        attention to the interaction between encoded room acoustics and synthetic
        reverbs A main challenge was maintaining clarity when the player moved quickly
        through the environment and when transitions between rooms occurred </p>

        <p> Comparing the two approaches I observed that binaural detail strengthens
        character centric cues while ambisonic fields create a coherent backdrop that
        supports pacing and location memory For interactive narrative design the decision
        between precision and cohesion depends on which narrative beats require attention
        and which should remain ambient Practical recommendations include using binaural
        for targeted effects and ambisonics for overarching atmosphere and automating
        level of detail based on player proximity to sources This workflow improved
        immersion and reduced masking of important cues in test sessions </p>

        <p> Future iterations will include dynamic occlusion modeling and hybrid decoding
        strategies to balance performance and perceptual accuracy Testing with diverse
        listening setups will be central to refining the toolkit and ensuring narrative
        intent translates across player devices </p>

    - body: '<p>For this assignment I created three synthesized sound effects intended
        for short interactive triggers in a fantasy game. The three assets are labeled
        Chest Open, Enchanted Slash, and Potion Pour. My approach combined modular
        synthesis techniques with targeted field recordings to achieve both organic
        detail and precise control for interactive variation.</p>

        <p>Chest Open uses a layered structure. The core tonal body was made with
        two detuned FM operators to get a bell like metallic bloom. I applied a short
        pitch envelope to emphasize the initial impact and a high frequency lowpass
        envelope to let the brightness decay naturally. On top of that I layered a
        recorded wooden creak and a leather slide recorded with a small contact mic.
        Granular processing on a short water drop recording added tiny crystalline
        grains for a magical shimmer. I convolved a stereo impulse recorded in a small
        chapel to place the event in a roomy but intimate space. For interactivity
        I mapped an intensity parameter to overall pitch and wetness using middleware
        RTPCs so that harder interactions raise pitch slightly and increase convolution
        wet level.</p>

        <p>Enchanted Slash focuses on transient aggression with a lingering tail.
        I started with a short burst from a virtual wave table oscillator processed
        through a saturator and transient shaper to create an initial bite. A pitch
        shifted clack from a metal file provided the high end attack. For the mystical
        tail I generated evolving textures using a granular synth fed by a recording
        of rustling chain mail. Modulation of grain size and density by velocity parameters
        allows variation per swing. I added subtle Doppler style pitch modulation
        in engine to convey movement across the listener field.</p>

        <p>Potion Pour was built from layered field recordings of water, film canister
        sounds for bubble pops, and soft glass taps. I synthesized a low sub rumble
        with slow LFO movement to imply arcane energy. I processed the water texture
        with a resonant bandpass that is driven by an interaction parameter so that
        larger pours emphasize lower resonant peaks. Randomized start offsets and
        slight pitch detuning between repeats reduce machine like repetition during
        rapid interactions.</p>

        <p>Implementation notes: I exported dry stems and a wet master for each effect
        and provided exposed parameters for volume, pitch, filter cutoff, and reverb
        send. In my Wwise patch I used RTPC mapping for intensity and position and
        implemented a voice limiting strategy to conserve CPU. I tested behavior in
        Unity across three distance falloff curves and adjusted convolution send levels
        to keep clarity on mobile hardware. Overall the assets balance immediate clarity
        for short triggers with enough spectral detail to reward close listening and
        adaptive variation.</p>

        scene in a short interactive sequence. The scene presents three primary player
        choice paths that change the emotional arc of the scene while keeping the
        core cinematic motif intact. The logic tree uses a root music motif that can
        be transformed by three parallel layers that respond to player choice type
        emotion intensity and timing. Layer one is the melodic motif which can shift
        in harmony to major minor or modal variants to convey acceptance conflict
        or ambiguity. Layer two is the ambisonic bed which adjusts spatial movement
        and reverberation to reflect distance and psychological perspective. Layer
        three is the reactive effects layer which triggers character specific risers
        hits and textural springs at key branch points to punctuate decisions.</p>

        <p>The node structure is hierarchical. Root node holds the motif state and
        global tempo. Branch nodes represent discrete player choices and contain transition
        rules. Each transition rule specifies crossfade duration parameter priority
        of audio layers and a probability modifier for subtle randomized variations.
        For cinematic continuity crossfade durations are synchronized to beat subdivisions
        to preserve musical phrasing across cuts. Transition rules also include memory
        flags so that earlier choices influence later music motifs without abrupt
        changes. For example a forgiveness flag lowers dissonance values and biases
        the melodic layer toward consonant intervals.</p>

        <p>Implementation notes cover middleware mapping and performance considerations.
        Key parameters are exposed as snapshot states in the audio engine so that
        parameter ramps are handled by the engine and not by loading new assets. Using
        RTPC style controls the mix between the motif variants while event callbacks
        trigger short effect hits. Random micro variations are seeded from scene state
        to keep repeated playthroughs cinematic but not identical. Testing plans include
        scripted playthroughs to validate smoothness of crossfades dynamic range checks
        to avoid clipping and play percent tests to ensure that important musical
        beats align with choice moments.</p>

        <p>Overall the audio logic tree balances adaptive responsiveness with cinematic
        cohesion. The design prioritizes preserving thematic identity while allowing
        meaningful audio variation that reinforces player agency. The attached outline
        lists nodes transitions and parameter mappings for reference.</p> '

    - body: <p>For this assignment I designed an interactive sound patch that uses
        dynamic reverb and environmental effects to reflect player position and material
        properties The project includes a short scene built in a game engine where
        reverb pre delay decay and early reflections are modulated by distance and
        room type The method involved creating parameter zones adding occlusion filters
        and automating transitions based on simple state machines I tested the system
        with ten volunteers who navigated the scene and rated immersion and audio
        realism on a five point scale The expected result is that adaptive reverb
        settings will increase immersion ratings compared to static reverb presets

    - body: '<p>Implementing dialog systems with middleware in the context of cinematic
        sound design requires both a design mindset and an awareness of engineering
        constraints. Middleware serves as the bridge between the dialog manager and
        the audio engine allowing narrative events to trigger adaptive soundscapes
        and dynamic musical cues. By routing intent and state information through
        a message bus, designers can map conversational outcomes to layered audio
        assets, parameterized effects, and spatialization rules. This approach supports
        continuity across branching scenes and permits runtime adjustments without
        rebuilding the audio mix. Key considerations include event naming conventions,
        latency budgets, synchronization of audio and lip sync, and preserving authorable
        control for sound designers. When done well middleware empowers storytellers
        to craft responsive audio that reinforces emotion and pacing in interactive
        narratives.</p>

      user: main_user
    - body: '<p>A practical implementation often uses a lightweight event broker running
        alongside the dialog engine. Messages carry high level tags and state markers
        that the audio middleware subscribes to in order to modulate stems and effect
        parameters. In a prototype this can be done with standard protocols and an
        adapter layer that translates dialog intents into audio events. Attention
        must be paid to network jitter and queueing since timing is critical for cinematic
        impact. Test cases should include interrupted lines, overlapping cues, and
        rapid branch switches to ensure the sound system remains coherent. Documentation
        for the mapping layer helps maintain handoff between narrative designers and
        audio programmers, enabling iterative refinement of the interactive soundtrack.</p>

        reverb wetness, and density parameters. Parameters are mapped to gameplay
        variables using exponential curves to preserve perceptual smoothness. I implemented
        crossfading between layers to avoid artifacts and added a light randomization

  pages:
  - body: 'Spatial audio is essential for crafting immersive moments in interactive
      storytelling. This page summarizes practical techniques for spatializing sound
      in games and narrative projects, focusing on perceptual clarity and adaptive
      workflows. Covered topics include ambisonics and binaural rendering, head related
      transfer function approaches and their approximations, realtime spatialization
      inside popular engines, and audio middleware integration with FMOD and Wwise.
      We outline strategies for mixing in dynamic scenes where listener position and
      camera control change over time, plus methods for simulating room acoustics
      and occlusion in interactive contexts. Performance considerations address cpu
      budgets, level of detail for distant sources, and batching to reduce overhead.
      Hands on exercises will guide you through creating spatial mixes, performing
      listening tests on headphones and multichannel setups, and iterating based on
      player feedback. Links to sample plugins, reference projects, and further readings
      are provided for continued study

        genres contract text statutory provisions and judicial opinions I argue that

        each genre enforces a distinct register through lexico syntactic choices and

        rhetorical stance For example contracts tend to use dense nominalization

        modal hedging and formulaic phrases that aim to limit ambiguity while

        allocating risk Statutes often employ prescriptive declarative structures

        and defined terms which create a closed interpretive system Judicial opinions

        combine narrative voice with argumentative moves using citations and explicit

        balancing language to justify outcomes</p>


        <p>From a forensic perspective these differences matter because they affect

        how meaning is inferred and how attribution and intent are assessed Registers

        influence clues about formality authorship and audience For instance the

        presence of inconsistent register features across clauses may indicate

        multiple drafters or later amendment Features such as passive constructions

        and nominalization can obscure agency which has legal consequences in cases

        about responsibility</p>


        <p>I connect these observations to course concepts such as genre expectation

        schematic devices and pragmatic inference I also discuss how formulaic

        language in legal genres both stabilizes interpretation and creates sites

        where ambiguity may be exploited In conclusion understanding register and

    submissions:
    - body: <p>In reading a recent appellate opinion I noticed repeated use of the
        word however to signal qualification and contrast in the court argument. The
        opinion begins by stating the factual background and then uses however to
        introduce a limiting principle that narrows the reach of a broader precedent.
        This marker shifts the reader from description to evaluation and encourages
        close attention to the court line of reasoning. Later the opinion uses therefore
        to mark a logical step toward the ruling and to show how the court moves from
        premise to conclusion. In one passage moreover appears to accumulate supporting
        points in favor of the majority view while a dissenting paragraph uses notwithstanding
        to resist the majority account and to highlight unresolved counterarguments.
        These discourse markers do more than signal logical relations they shape the
        pace of the narration and guide the reader interpretation of which facts count
        as decisive. Notably the placement of a marker at the beginning of a paragraph
        creates a framing effect that primes the reader for a particular inferential
        move. When the court inserts a marker mid sentence the effect is milder but
        still cues a micro shift in the argumentative direction. By tracking these
        markers across two opinions I show how they function as rhetorical tools that
        manage legal precedent and persuade readers of the soundness of an outcome.
        I draw on basic concepts from discourse analysis to argue that markers operate
        at the interface of cohesion and argumentative strategy and that awareness
        of their use can reveal implicit priorities in judicial reasoning.</p>

    - body: <p>During a mock trial exercise I reviewed an expert witness transcript
        concerning a forensic voice comparison. The expert offered confident assertions
        about speaker identity while relying on limited acoustic samples and without
        fully explaining variability introduced by recording conditions. I noticed
        frequent hedging terms and modal verbs when discussing uncertainty but a shift
        to more assertive language when addressing conclusions. This pattern made
        me consider how linguistic choices affect perceived authority. Applying concepts
        from forensic linguistics and pragmatics, I analyzed instances of stance,
        certainty marking, and evidentiality in the testimony. I then evaluated how
        these features might influence a jury and proposed targeted cross examination
        questions to expose methodological gaps and clarify limits of the expert opinion.
        This exercise highlighted the importance of transparent methodological reporting
        and the need to translate technical findings into terms that preserve nuance

    - body: <p>In this sample confession analysis I examined two anonymized letters
        purportedly written by the same individual. My close stylistic reading focused
        on pronoun use, verb tense patterns, modal auxiliaries, and clause complexity.
        Letter A shows frequent first person singular constructions, consistent past
        tense narration, and limited use of hedges, suggesting a confident recounting
        of events. Letter B contains evasive shifts to passive voice, increased use
        of indefinite pronouns, and more hedging language such as may and might, which
        could indicate reluctance or external influence. I also considered punctuation
        patterns and lineation, noting irregular comma use and abrupt paragraph breaks
        in Letter B that align with signs of stress or hurried composition. Comparing
        the lexical choices, Letter A uses specific concrete nouns while Letter B
        relies on vague terms and generalities. These differential markers support
        a hypothesis that Letter B may have been influenced by coercion or coached
        content. For authorship attribution I applied Burrows' delta measures to a
        select set of function words and computed distance metrics. The results showed
        greater similarity between the two samples than to the control set, but stylistic
        differences remain significant and merit cautious interpretation in legal
        contexts. I conclude by discussing how courts assess linguistic evidence,
        emphasizing the need for corroborating material and expert testimony to avoid
        overreliance on stylistic impressions.</p>

    - body: <p> In a recent municipal bylaw I examined a provision regulating parking
        during street maintenance. The relevant sentence stated that vehicles must
        not remain in a marked cleaning zone on cleaning days for longer than two
        hours. One interpretation reads the rule as limiting any single parking episode
        to two hours while another interpretation treats the limit as an aggregate
        per calendar day meaning a vehicle may not be parked in the zone for more
        than two hours in total across the day. The ambiguity arises from unclear
        attachment of the temporal phrase and from the scope of the quantifier. From
        a linguistic point of view this is an instance of attachment ambiguity and
        scope ambiguity that semanticists often analyze using formal tools. In legal
        contexts the outcome can alter enforcement practices and compliance burdens.
        Forensic linguistic analysis highlights syntactic structure and contextual
        cues that point to one reading over another and suggests drafting revisions
        to remove uncertainty. This case illustrates why precise temporal language
        and explicit scope markers are essential in statutory drafting. </p>

    - body: '<p> This report examines a small anonymized set of text messages to trace
        patterns of threat and risk language. I coded messages for direct threats,
        implied threat, conditional risk statements, and references to weapons or
        harm. Direct threats typically used explicit future oriented verbs combined
        with personal targets. Implied threats relied on vague outcomes and social
        pressure to suggest harm without naming a specific act. Conditional risk statements
        framed possible harm as dependent on recipient action or inaction which increases
        ambiguity in attribution. </p>

        <p> I provide representative excerpts from the corpus and explain coding decisions
        for each excerpt. The analysis highlights how modality and temporal framing
        shift a message from an interpersonal dispute into language that may be construed
        as a credible risk. I conclude with a short discussion of how these linguistic
        markers could inform triage protocols for law enforcement and recommendations
        for clearer annotation guidelines in forensic casework. </p>

      from forensic linguistics or discourse analysis such as speech act theory, politeness
      theory, or conversation analysis. Include specific excerpted lines and explain

    - body: <p>This paper examines a segment of trial discourse to identify how turn
        taking, question design, and repair practices shape witness credibility and
        attorney control. Drawing on speech act theory and conversation analysis,
        the analysis shows how directives, presuppositions, and framing devices operate
        to constrain testimony. Excerpts illustrate the strategic use of pauses, interruptions,
        and tag questions to redirect attention and to assert institutional authority.
        The study concludes that courtroom interaction is a site where language indexes
        power and constructs legal reality through sequential organization and rhetorical
        maneuvers.</p>

  - body: "Forensic linguistics applies linguistic theory and empirical methods to\
      \ the analysis of language related evidence\n   in legal and investigative contexts.\
      \ Analysts examine patterns of lexis and grammar to address questions of\n \
      \  authorship attribution, document authenticity, and the wording of confessions\
      \ or threats. Methods range from\n   corpus driven comparisons and computational\
      \ stylometry to careful phonetic analysis of recorded speech,\n   always paired\
      \ with explicit statements about uncertainty and scope of inference. Courtroom\
      \ discourse is\n   treated as a distinct communicative environment shaped by\
      \ procedural norms role relations and strategic\n   interactional moves among\
      \ judge counsel witness and jurors. Good practice emphasizes transparent methodology\n\
      \   preservation of original materials clear reporting of limitations and a\
      \ commitment to ethical handling of\n   sensitive evidence to support fair and\
      \ reliable decision making in legal settings\n"

    - body: '<p>Green bonds are debt instruments that finance projects with environmental
        benefits such as renewable energy sustainable transport or climate resilient
        infrastructure. Regulatory frameworks help build market trust by defining
        eligibility criteria setting disclosure expectations and outlining verification
        practices. Market guidance such as the Green Bond Principles promoted by the
        International Capital Market Association focuses on use of proceeds project
        evaluation management of proceeds and ongoing reporting to ensure transparency
        and accountability. Regional initiatives like the EU green taxonomy and the
        proposed EU Green Bond Standard seek to harmonize definitions and create consistent
        disclosure requirements that reduce the risk of green washing and improve
        comparability for investors. External review and independent assurance are
        central components of credible frameworks. Third party verifiers and certification
        schemes provide validation that projects meet stated environmental objectives
        and that reporting is accurate. Effective regulation can combine voluntary
        standards with mandatory disclosure rules tailored to local legal contexts
        to improve data quality and enable enforcement where needed. Common challenges
        include differing national approaches limited issuer capacity in emerging
        markets and evolving scientific thresholds for eligibility. Policy recommendations
        include aligning national rules with international taxonomies supporting capacity
        building for issuers and verifiers and encouraging periodic impact reporting
        using standardized metrics. A balanced approach that integrates market led
        principles with targeted regulatory measures can scale the green bond market
        while safeguarding environmental integrity.</p>

    - body: <p> In this submission I examined a recent corporate sustainability report
        and a green bond prospectus to identify potential greenwashing Red flags included
        vague targets lack of time bound commitments and claims that relied solely
        on offsets rather than emissions reductions I compared the statements to the
        green bond use of proceeds criteria and to the climate finance taxonomy discussed
        in class and found several mismatches For example the issuer characterized
        a project as climate positive without providing measurable performance indicators
        or a timeline for impact I also reviewed the stated role of offsets and found
        no evidence of permanence or avoidance of double counting Additionally limited
        third party assurance was cited but did not cover core impact claims Through
        this exercise I applied course concepts such as additionality transparency
        alignment with taxonomies and the role of governance in mitigating mislabeling

    - body: '<p>This proposal outlines a local currency green bond to finance rural
        solar mini grid deployment in a coastal West African country. The issuer would
        be a development finance vehicle partnered with a municipal authority, and
        the objective is to expand affordable clean electricity access for households
        and small enterprises while reducing diesel use and associated emissions.
        The bond will be denominated in the local currency to match revenue streams
        and to reduce foreign exchange exposure for local users and operators.</p>

        <p>The financing structure combines a senior local currency green bond with
        a subordinated tranche provided by a concessional lender for credit enhancement.
        A partial guarantee from a regional development bank will improve ratings
        and attract pension fund investors. Revenues will derive from tariffs collected
        in the local currency and from a small operations and maintenance reserve
        funded at closing. Tenors will range from five to twelve years to align with
        project cash flow profiles. Covenants will require transparency on tariff
        setting and a ring fenced account for reserve funding.</p>

        <p>To manage currency risk the design relies on natural hedging through local
        currency revenues and by avoiding hard currency debt at the project level.
        Where limited foreign currency exposure remains, a hedging buffer will be
        established using a currency stabilization facility supported by a multilateral
        partner. Credit risk mitigation measures include a debt service reserve account,
        step in rights for the sponsor, and technical assistance grants to ensure
        operational readiness.</p>

        <p>Impact measurement will follow international green bond principles and
        use metrics such as megawatt hours of clean electricity delivered, estimated
        annual fossil fuel displacement, number of households connected, and local
        jobs created. Independent verification of green use of proceeds and annual
        impact reporting will be required. The project will also include a local capacity
        building component to strengthen utility billing systems and community engagement.</p>

        <p>Overall this local currency green financing approach aims to mobilize domestic
        institutional capital, support local currency markets, and deliver measurable
        climate and development benefits while minimizing foreign exchange risk for
        communities and operators.</p>

    - body: <p>For this assignment I prepared an impact reporting outline for a green
        bond intended to finance coastal wetland restoration aimed at carbon sequestration
        and biodiversity enhancement. The report starts with a clear statement of
        objectives including target hectares restored, expected annual CO2e removal,
        and indicators for habitat quality. I selected measurable metrics such as
        tonnes of CO2 equivalent sequestered per year, number of native species returned,
        and area restored in hectares. Baseline data was collected from local ecological
        surveys and carbon stock assessments prior to project start. Monitoring will
        rely on a mix of remote sensing for area and vegetation cover, periodic on
        site surveys for species assessments, and carbon sampling using established
        protocols. Verification will be sought annually from an independent third
        party following accepted standards. The report also includes a section on
        potential co benefits and negative impacts with proposed mitigation measures.
        To align with best practice I mapped each metric to relevant market frameworks
        and explained frequency of reporting and data sources. Finally I discussed
        how funds mobilized will be tracked and linked to eligible expenditures ensuring
        transparency. This structure reflects principles from green bond market guidance
        on clarity and verifiability of impact claims. </p>

    - body: '<p>I performed a scenario stress test on a hypothetical 100 million fixed
        income portfolio composed of 60 percent sovereign bonds, 30 percent corporate
        bonds and 10 percent green bonds. I selected three scenarios aligned with
        NGFS and IEA narratives to capture a range of plausible futures. The first
        scenario represents an orderly transition with early policy action and mild
        repricing of carbon intensive issuers. The second scenario represents a disorderly
        transition where late policy intervention triggers abrupt repricing and higher
        spreads for transition sensitive sectors. The third scenario captures severe
        physical risks with increased frequency of extreme weather events affecting
        sovereign revenue and corporate operations. </p>

        <p>My approach combined a top down macro shock to interest rates and risk
        premia with bottom up issuer level vulnerability scores. For transition shocks
        I applied spread widening to issuers in high emissions sectors based on intensity
        metrics and transition readiness indicators. For physical shocks I modeled
        increased expected credit losses for sovereigns with low adaptive capacity
        and for corporates with high regional exposure. Green bonds were treated with
        a lower spread shock reflecting perceived resilience and earmarked use of
        proceeds. I used a one year horizon for primary results and conducted sensitivity
        tests over three year horizons. </p>

        <p>Results showed portfolio value losses of approximately 3 percent under
        the orderly transition, 9 percent under the disorderly transition and 7 percent
        under the physical severe scenario in the one year horizon. Concentration
        in high sovereign exposure and several corporate issuers in energy and heavy
        industry drove much of the downside in the disorderly outcome. Green bonds
        exhibited lower downside in transition scenarios but were not immune in the
        physical scenario where project level vulnerability mattered. Sensitivity
        analyses indicated that assumptions about correlation between sovereign and
        corporate shocks and about recovery rates materially affect loss estimates.
        </p>

        <p>Key limitations include data quality for issuer level climate exposures,
        uncertainty in policy timing, and simplified treatment of liquidity effects.
        I recommend enhancing stress testing by incorporating scenario based cash
        flow adjustments, dynamic repricing over multiple periods, and explicit liquidity
        stress modules. Governance recommendations include periodic reruns under updated
        scenarios, integration of results into capital allocation and hedging decisions,
        and disclosure aligned with TCFD guidance. Overall, the exercise highlighted
        the value of combining top down scenarios with bottom up issuer analysis to
        inform risk management of climate related threats to fixed income portfolios.

    - body: '<p>For this assignment I assessed the public ESG disclosures of a mid
        cap issuer in the utilities sector to evaluate how well the firm reports climate
        exposures and performance. I focused on scope 1 and scope 2 emissions metrics,
        capital expenditures for low carbon transition, and whether the company provided
        third party assurance on key indicators. I mapped disclosed items against
        two common frameworks to highlight alignment and gaps. First I used a global
        reporting framework that emphasizes stakeholder oriented disclosure across
        environmental economic and social topics. Second I used a sector focused standard
        that concentrates on financially material climate related metrics. This dual
        framework approach helped reveal that the issuer reported basic emissions
        figures and a high level decarbonization target but did not disclose year
        to year emissions intensity for key business segments nor did it provide verifiable
        data on financed emissions for major project portfolios.</p>

        <p>Data quality problems included inconsistent boundaries for operations and
        lack of clear methodologies for emissions estimation. The absence of assurance
        on emission factors and incomplete scope 3 coverage reduced confidence in
        the data. From a climate finance perspective these disclosure gaps can hinder
        investor pricing of transition risk and complicate the issuance of use of
        proceeds green debt. I recommend clearer materiality disclosure, standardized
        metrics by segment, and external assurance for principal climate indicators.
        I also suggest that the issuer adopt a recognized taxonomy mapping and provide
        a reconciled table linking reported metrics to bond proceeds allocation to
        improve transparency for green bond markets.</p>

        <p>Overall this evaluation demonstrates the importance of consistent measurement
        frameworks and robust data governance for climate related finance. The exercise
        ties directly to course topics on market integrity and the need for investor
        ready ESG disclosure when mobilizing capital for low carbon transitions.</p>

        environmental benefits such as renewable energy sustainable transport and
        climate adaptation. Key features include use of proceeds reporting and verification

        like green bond principles and regional taxonomies help reduce greenwashing

        sovereign green bond programs demonstrate how proceeds can be tracked and
        evaluated while also highlighting challenges around impact measurement and
        additionality. From an investor perspective green bonds can broaden the investor
        base and lower funding costs for eligible projects but require rigorous disclosure

        with targeted credit enhancement. Better disclosure reduces information asymmetry
        so investors can assess climate risk, and guarantees or first loss facilities
        make early stage projects bankable for institutional capital. Key challenges

      participants range from sovereign and municipal issuers to development banks
      and corporations each facing trade offs between cost of capital and credibility.  Investors
      evaluate credit risk, climate related transition and physical risks, and the
      integrity of labeling to avoid greenwashing.  Policy frameworks taxation incentives
      and standardised disclosure regimes play a central role in scaling issuance
      and improving market liquidity.  Case studies and empirical evidence help students
      assess pricing, additionality, and the real world outcomes of green bond financing.  This
      page provides an overview of concepts methodologies and practical tools for
      analysing green bond instruments within the broader climate finance landscape.

    - text: Good prompt. For a municipal portal focus on data exposure and privileged
        access. Start by listing assets and mapping trust boundaries. Use a matrix

        items.

      user: main_user
    - text: I like using STRIDE to categorize threats. For example spoofing maps to
        credential attacks which you can reduce with strong authentication and monitoring.
        Prioritize fixes where both likelihood and impact are high.
      user: terrance@instituterson.ca
    - text: Remember to include residual risk and a plan for acceptance or transfer.
        Some mitigations may be too costly so a clear risk owner helps with decision

    - body: '<p> During this assignment I conducted a controlled dynamic analysis
        of a Windows based malware sample inside an isolated virtual environment.
        My approach began with static reconnaissance to identify strings, import tables,
        and potential packing. Static review suggested use of API calls commonly associated
        with process injection and service installation. Moving to dynamic analysis
        I executed the sample in a sandbox with network emulation disabled and monitored
        system changes using process monitors, registry watchers, and filesystem activity
        logs. </p>

        <p> The sample created a scheduled task and modified autorun registry keys
        to achieve persistence. I observed a launcher process spawning a child process
        that injected code into explorer.exe, consistent with common process hollowing
        techniques. Network indicators included DNS queries to unusual domains and
        an outbound connection to an IP on a nonstandard high port. Packet captures
        showed an obfuscated HTTP POST pattern that appears to exfiltrate small encrypted
        blobs. I correlated these artifacts with common indicators of compromise and
        noted file drops in temporary directories with timestamps matching execution
        events. </p>

        <p> In terms of tools, I used static utilities for binary interrogation, a
        sandbox for behavior tracing, and a combination of sysmon logs and network
        captures to build a timeline. For mitigation, I recommend restricting executable
        privilege escalation, monitoring scheduled task creation, enforcing DNS filtering,
        and deploying endpoint detection rules for process injection signatures. I
        also outline how to safely report and share sanitized indicators with incident
        response teams. </p>

        <p> This analysis highlights the importance of layered defenses and the role
        of telemetry in detecting behavior that may bypass signature based controls.
        Future work could include memory forensics to extract injected code and deeper
        reverse engineering to understand the payload logic. </p> '

        and control platform used by a mid sized city. I started by mapping assets
        including sensors controllers data storage and operator interfaces and then
        drew trust boundaries to show which components were exposed to public networks
        and which were within internal control networks. I enumerated potential adversaries
        such as opportunistic internet attackers nation state actors and malicious

        a mix of concern and motivation to learn more. Behaviorally I responded by
        breaking the task into smaller phases mapping then enumeration then mitigation
        design and by scheduling short review sessions with a peer to check assumptions.
        Coping strategies I used included adopting a checklist driven approach to
        stay organized and taking brief breaks to avoid cognitive overload. These
        approaches reflect problem solving strategies from cognitive load theory and
        reflective practice models often taught in security pedagogy. The exercise
        increased my confidence in systematic analysis and highlighted the value of

        for an academic department that handles sensitive research data. The playbook
        begins with preparation steps that include asset inventory, logging and monitoring,
        defined roles and responsibilities, and tabletop exercise schedules. The identification
        section outlines how to detect anomalous activity using IDS alerts, endpoint
        telemetry and user reports, and specifies criteria for declaring an incident.
        Containment strategies cover short term isolation of affected hosts, network
        segmentation, and staged communication to avoid tipping off an adversary.
        Eradication and recovery steps describe forensic imaging, secure wiping of
        compromised systems, restoration from verified backups and validation of integrity
        before returning services to production. A dedicated evidence handling appendix
        details chain of custody forms, hash verification, secure storage and timelines
        for preservation to support investigations and any required legal actions.
        </p>

        <p> The playbook also includes a ransomware runbook with a checklist for initial
        triage, indicators to collect, external reporting contacts and a decision
        grid for paying or refusing ransom that weighs legal and ethical considerations.
        Communication templates for internal stakeholders and public notification
        are provided along with roles for media liaison and legal counsel. Finally,
        a lessons learned procedure requires a post incident review within two weeks,
        updates to playbooks and scheduled retraining. The assignment links these
        steps to civic cybersecurity concepts such as responsible disclosure, protection
        of community research assets and coordination with public sector responders

    message: This week I want to open a conversation about legal and policy frameworks
      that guide ethical hacking in our course and in professional practice. Topics
      to consider include authorized testing and scopes of work, responsible disclosure
      processes, data protection and privacy constraints, and how institutional policies
      differ from public bug bounty programs. Please share examples from your experience
      or questions you have about staying compliant while doing security testing

  - Proficiency in ethical penetration testing methods
  pages:
  - body: 'This page defines responsible disclosure and bug bounty practices for Ethical
      Hacking and Civic Cybersecurity 304. It sets expectations for authorized testing,
      safe proof of concept development, concise reporting, legal considerations,
      and coordination with vendors and incident response teams. Adhering to these
      practices protects students, researchers, and community partners and reinforces
      ethical and civic minded security work.

      Guiding principles and rules

      - Obtain explicit authorization before testing any system or service

      - Limit testing to agreed scope and avoid collateral impact on third party users

      - Do not exfiltrate or retain sensitive data and avoid destructive techniques
      such as denial of service

      - Avoid social engineering and physical intrusion unless explicitly permitted

      Reporting expectations

      - Provide a short summary of the issue and its practical impact on users or
      services

      - Include clear reproduction steps and a minimal proof of concept

      - Describe root cause analysis and suggested remediation or mitigation steps

      - Estimate severity and potential mitigations based on risk to civic infrastructure

      Timelines and disclosure

      - Report issues privately to the responsible party and course staff when relevant

      - Allow a standard remediation window of 90 days before public disclosure unless
      urgent risk requires earlier action

      - Coordinate public disclosure to ensure fixes are available and to prevent
      harm

      Recognition and rewards

      - Researchers who follow these practices will be acknowledged in a manner agreed
      with the affected party

      - Bug bounties or course credit may be awarded based on impact and quality of
      the report

      Legal and safety notes

      - Ensure your work complies with applicable laws and the institution code of
      conduct

      - If in doubt seek prior approval from course instructors or legal advisors

      Contact and escalation

      - Use the official course reporting channel to submit findings and to request
      safe harbor or authorization

      - In emergencies contact the instructor and the campus security team for coordinated
      response

      Following these guidelines helps build trust between researchers and defenders
      and supports responsible, civic focused cybersecurity scholarship
