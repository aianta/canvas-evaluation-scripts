    - body: '<p>My data management and reproducibility plan for the team project centers
        on clear structure, consistent documentation, and tools that make analysis
        repeatable. First I will establish a top level folder for the project with
        subfolders for raw data processed data scripts notebooks figures and documentation.
        Raw data will be write once and never overwritten. Any cleaning or transformation
        will occur in the processed data folder with scripts that convert raw inputs
        to processed outputs so that every step is executable and traceable.</p>

        <p>File naming conventions will include project acronym an ISO date and a
        brief descriptor separated by underscores for readability. For example a sequencing
        file might be named projectA_20250715_reads.fastq and a cleaned table might
        be projectA_20250716_expression_cleaned.csv. A data dictionary in the documentation
        folder will define variable names units and expected value ranges so that
        others can interpret files without direct consultation.</p>

        <p>All code and analysis scripts will be tracked in a git repository hosted
        on a team platform with branch based development. Each analysis will be captured
        in a notebook that combines narrative code and outputs. Notebooks will be
        parameterized where appropriate to avoid manual edits and to allow rerunning
        with different inputs. For computational environments we will provide an environment
        specification file and a lightweight container configuration so results can
        be reproduced across machines.</p>

        <p>Metadata standards will follow community recommendations where available.
        For datasets we will include provenance information creator contact methods
        collection date and processing steps in a machine readable metadata file.
        Backups will be automated with daily snapshots of raw data and weekly snapshots
        of processed data and code. Sensitive information will be stored in encrypted
        locations with access logs and only shared after appropriate de identification
        and approvals.</p>

        <p>For reproducibility validation we will assign a team member to independently
        run the full analysis from raw data to figures using the provided instructions
        and record any deviations. Versioned releases of the code and data artifacts
        will be created and linked to a project README that explains how to reproduce
        key results. When appropriate we will deposit final datasets and code in an
        open repository with a persistent identifier and a clear license that permits
        reuse with attribution.</p>

        <p>Roles and responsibilities will be documented so that one person owns the
        data dictionary another manages backups and a code lead oversees version control
        and container builds. Regular checkpoints will ensure documentation stays
        current and a final reproducibility checklist will be completed before submission.</p>

    - body: '<p>This proposal outlines a screening strategy to discover small molecule
        modulators of an engineered transcriptional regulator used in a synthetic
        biology circuit. The primary assay will be a homogeneous luminescence readout
        in 384 well plates to maximize throughput while keeping reagent costs reasonable.
        We will optimize a reaction volume of 20 microliters per well to ensure robust
        signal to noise and compatibility with standard automated liquid handlers.
        The detection modality is luminescence because it offers low background and
        good dynamic range for this reporter system.</p>

        <p>Assay development will begin with target and reagent titrations to establish
        linear response and to select an enzyme or reporter concentration that yields
        reproducible signal across wells. Positive control wells will contain a known
        activator or inhibitor depending on the desired direction of modulation. Negative
        control wells will contain vehicle only. We will include intra plate controls
        on every plate, plus inter plate control columns to monitor drift. Plate layout
        will randomize compound positions to reduce systematic edge effects.</p>

        <p>Key quality metrics will be monitored during pilot runs. We will calculate
        Z prime for each plate and aim for Z prime greater than 0.5 as a threshold
        for a robust assay. Signal to background and coefficient of variation will
        also be tracked. If Z prime is marginal, we will iterate on reagent concentrations,
        incubation times, or assay buffering to improve assay window. For data processing
        we will apply plate based normalization and median polish or B score methods
        to correct spatial bias. Hit calling will use robust statistics such as activity
        relative to plate median plus three median absolute deviations, and a secondary
        filter of minimal percent effect relative to controls to avoid spurious calls.</p>

        <p>Follow up triage includes counterscreens to identify assay interferents
        and pan assay interference compounds. We will run an orthogonal assay using
        a different detection principle, for example a fluorescence based reporter
        or gel based activity readout, to confirm on target activity. Confirmed hits
        will proceed to dose response curves to determine potency and selectivity,
        and will be evaluated for cytotoxicity in a cell viability assay if relevant.</p>

        <p>Automation considerations include programming the liquid handler for accurate
        low volume dispensing, incorporating tip reuse policies to avoid cross talk,
        and scheduling plate transfers to minimize timing variation. Sample tracking

    - body: <p>For this assignment I developed a pathway to convert glucose into a
        medium chain polyketide in Escherichia coli. I began by surveying native and
        heterologous routes and selected a set of enzymes based on reported turnover
        numbers and substrate specificity. I built a stoichiometric model and performed
        flux balance analysis to predict bottlenecks and theoretical yields. The model
        indicated a limitation at the acyl carrier protein cycle, so I proposed increasing
        flux through the upstream supply of malonyl CoA by overexpressing acetyl CoA
        carboxylase and redirecting acetyl CoA from competing pathways. I incorporated
        cofactor considerations by preferring NADPH dependent reductases and suggested
        enhancing NADPH generation through pentose phosphate pathway upregulation.
        For genetic construction I planned modular expression cassettes with tunable
        promoters and ribosome binding sites to balance enzyme levels, and codon optimized
        coding sequences to improve translation. I also described measures to reduce
        byproduct formation by knocking down competing decarboxylases and implementing
        dynamic regulation to limit pathway flux during early growth phases. The experimental
        workflow includes building a small combinatorial library of expression variants,
        measuring intermediate concentrations and product titer, and iterating design
        based on measured fluxes. Finally I proposed adaptive laboratory evolution
        for tolerance improvements and outlined criteria for success based on product
        yield per glucose consumed and strain stability over serial culturing.</p>

        comment: Strong integration of modeling and practical design choices. Good

    - body: <p>In this assignment I construct a deterministic model of gene expression
        for a single gene under simple negative feedback. I present a system of ordinary
        differential equations for mRNA and protein concentrations and explain each
        term and parameter. The mRNA production term uses a Hill function to capture
        repression by the protein and degradation terms are first order. I include
        plausible parameter values chosen from literature ranges and run numerical
        simulations to show steady state behavior and response to perturbations. Results
        include time series showing relaxation to steady state and a parameter sweep
        showing how Hill coefficient and degradation rates affect expression levels.
        I discuss limitations of the deterministic approach and note how intrinsic
        noise could alter dynamics, motivating stochastic simulation as a next step.
        Finally I reflect on biological assumptions such as constant cell volume and
        fixed promoter copy number and suggest experimental measurements that could
        validate the model. Code used for simulations is provided in a separate file

        dedicated work areas sealed for negative pressure when relevant and validated
        sterilization workflows for all effluents. The proposal also covers monitoring

      text: One ethical challenge I keep returning to is dual use risk where tools
        we develop could be misapplied outside intended research This matters because
        even well intended projects can enable harm without controls I suggest documenting
        risk assessments restricting access to sensitive protocols and working with
        institutional biosafety officers to set sharing limits
