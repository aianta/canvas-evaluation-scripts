    - body: '<p> This policy brief addresses planetary protection requirements for
        a proposed robotic mission to a subsurface ocean world with evidence of transient
        surface liquid and possible biosignatures The goal is to evaluate risks of
        forward contamination and to recommend practical mitigation measures that
        align with international guidelines and ethical stewardship </p>

        <p> Forward contamination risk arises when terrestrial microbes or organic
        material are transferred to a target body and compromise the integrity of
        scientific investigation or native ecosystems To reduce this risk the mission
        should adopt a tiered sterilization strategy focused on high risk hardware
        and contact interfaces Critical components that will contact plume material
        or breach near surface ice must undergo the highest level of bioburden reduction
        for example heat or vapor hydrogen peroxide processes where material properties
        allow Non contact instruments and components enclosed within sealed compartments
        can undergo validated cleaning and contamination control procedures that achieve
        defined microbial limits </p>

        <p> Sample return pathways present an elevated hazard for forward and backward
        contamination For forward protection the mission architecture should avoid
        intentional transfer of surface material to orbital or Earth return stages
        unless strict containment is demonstrated For backward protection Earth return
        systems must include multi barrier containment and quarantine plans that can
        be executed if unexpected bioactive material is recovered Policy must require
        prelaunch documentation of containment design verification and on orbit test
        procedures </p>

        <p> International coordination is essential The mission should reference COSPAR
        recommendations and engage with relevant national authorities early in the
        design phase to ensure compliance and to contribute to shared risk assessments
        Transparency in protocols and publication of verification data will improve
        trust and scientific value The brief recommends a risk based decision framework
        that balances scientific objectives with contamination avoidance thresholds
        and cost considerations </p>

        <p> Recommended actions include adopting a graded sterilization plan aligned
        to contact risk performing scenario based contamination modeling implementing
        robust sample handling and containment for any return trajectory and committing
        to open dissemination of contamination control verification data These measures
        protect scientific integrity preserve extraterrestrial environments and uphold
        international obligations for responsible exploration </p>

    - body: '<p>This report outlines a proposed experimental simulation and an analysis
        of expected outcomes for microbial survival in Mars like conditions using
        a hardy model organism. The selected organism is Bacillus subtilis spores
        due to their known resistance to desiccation and radiation and their common
        use in astrobiology experiments. The goal of the experiment is to estimate
        survival fraction across a set of stressors that collectively approximate
        near surface Martian environmental factors.</p>

        <p>Methods Overview. A set of spore suspensions will be dried onto sterile
        glass coupons to simulate attachment to regolith particles. Coupons will be
        subjected to a low pressure chamber flushed with a CO2 rich gas mix at 6 millibar
        to match average Martian surface pressure. Temperature cycles will mimic diurnal
        swings between minus 80 degrees Celsius and minus 20 degrees Celsius as tolerated
        by the hardware. Ultraviolet exposure will be provided by a calibrated UV
        lamp that matches short wavelength flux estimated for Mars after accounting
        for thin ozone and dust. A desiccation only control will be held in ambient
        laboratory atmosphere at low humidity. Additional controls will include spores
        maintained in standard growth conditions and spores exposed to each stressor
        independently.</p>

        <p>Assays and Measurements. After defined exposure intervals of 24 hours 7
        days and 30 days coupons will be recovered and rehydrated to quantify viable
        spores via colony forming unit assays on rich media. Complementary methods
        will include microscopy to detect structural changes and qPCR to estimate
        DNA integrity. Survival fraction will be calculated relative to the untreated
        control. Repeats will be performed to allow basic statistical summaries and
        to identify variability.</p>

        <p>Predicted Results. Based on prior literature it is expected that combined
        stressors will reduce viable counts more strongly than single stressors. Short
        term exposure of 24 hours may show limited reduction as spores are highly
        resistant. At extended exposure times the cumulative effect of UV induced
        DNA lesions plus low temperature induced reduction in repair activity and
        prolonged desiccation is predicted to yield substantial viability loss. The
        desiccation only control is expected to show moderate viability decline while
        the low pressure CO2 environment without added radiation may have modest impact
        over the tested intervals.</p>

        <p>Discussion and Interpretation. These results if observed would support
        the idea that while certain terrestrial microbes can survive transiently on
        present day Mars like surfaces they are unlikely to maintain long term active
        metabolism without protective microniches or subsurface refugia. The experiment
        highlights that survival is multifactorial and that shielding by regolith
        aggregates or biofilms could meaningfully alter outcomes. If survival fractions
        at 30 days remain nonzero it would underscore the potential for forward contamination
        and the need for robust planetary protection procedures.</p>

        <p>Limitations. This design cannot fully replicate complex soil chemistry
        perchlorate interactions or long term seasonal cycles. Hardware constraints
        limit exact matching of solar spectrum and particle interaction. Viability
        assays detect culturability which may underrepresent cells in viable but non
        culturable states. Suggestions for improvement include adding simulated regolith
        substrates with relevant salts inclusion of a broader set of candidate organisms
        and exploring protective matrices such as clay or biofilm formation.</p>

        <p>Conclusion. A systematic series of experiments using spores on coupons
        in a multi stressor chamber can illuminate boundaries of microbial survival
        under Mars like surface conditions. Results will inform models of planetary
        habitability and guide both life detection strategies and planetary protection
        policy making.</p>

    - body: <p>My review examines two major proposed chemical pathways for the origin
        of life and considers observational and experimental evidence relevant to
        planetary habitability. The first pathway focuses on chemistry at alkaline
        hydrothermal vents where steep chemical gradients and mineral surfaces can
        concentrate reactants and catalyze redox reactions. Experiments simulating
        vent conditions have demonstrated formation of simple organic molecules and
        energy rich compounds under plausible prebiotic conditions. Mineral membranes
        and iron sulfur clusters provide plausible scaffolds for early metabolic networks
        and help explain how proton gradients could be harnessed for chemical work
        in the absence of biological membranes. These features make hydrothermal vents
        attractive targets when considering habitable niches on icy ocean worlds and
        on early Earth.</p><p>The second pathway considers atmospheric synthesis driven
        by electrical discharges and ultraviolet radiation in a reducing or weakly
        reducing atmosphere. Classic spark discharge experiments and more recent variations
        produce amino acids and other building blocks from simple gas mixtures. While
        modern Earth atmospheres may have been less reducing than early experiments
        assumed, local volcanic outgassing or transient reducing environments could
        permit similar chemistry. Surface chemistry in shallow pools combined with
        wet dry cycles aids polymer formation and concentration of reactants. This
        pathway emphasizes the importance of surface environments, fluctuating conditions,
        and access to energy from photons and electrical activity.</p><p>Comparing
        the two, hydrothermal vent chemistry provides continuous energy fluxes and
        mineral catalysis but requires liquid water and stable geochemistry. Atmospheric
        spark synthesis can operate in more varied planetary contexts but may need
        mechanisms for concentration and protection of fragile products. For planetary
        habitability assessments, both pathways highlight different observational
        targets. Detecting sustained chemical disequilibria, mineralogical signatures
        of catalytic surfaces, or transient reducing atmospheres could inform which
        pathways are plausible on a given world. Integrating geochemical modeling
        with laboratory simulations and remote sensing will help constrain the likelihood
        of each route on exoplanets and Solar System bodies. Overall, a pluralistic
        view that allows multiple complementary pathways best accounts for the diversity
        of plausible prebiotic scenarios and their implications for habitability.</p>

    - body: <p>For this assignment I analyzed the provided near infrared transmission
        spectrum of a transiting exoplanet. I began by performing a continuum normalization
        using a low order polynomial fit to spectral regions that appeared free of
        strong absorption. After dividing out the continuum I searched for statistically
        significant deviations by computing the local residuals and identifying minima
        that exceeded a three sigma threshold. To quantify line properties I fitted
        Gaussian profiles to each candidate feature using a least squares optimizer
        to obtain line centers, widths and depths. I then compared the measured line
        centers to molecular line lists for water vapor, methane and carbon monoxide.
        The strongest correspondences were with water vapor features near 1.4 microns
        and with carbon monoxide features near 2.3 microns. To estimate molecular
        abundances and atmospheric temperature I generated forward models with a simple
        radiative transfer code, varying temperature and mixing ratios and computing
        chi squared for each model. The best fit occurred for an atmospheric temperature
        near 1200 K and a water mixing ratio around 1e minus 4. I evaluated uncertainties
        by exploring a coarse grid of models and by performing bootstrap resampling
        of the residuals. I also examined potential systematics including telluric
        contamination and instrument line spread. For telluric correction I divided
        by a contemporaneous standard star spectrum and masked regions with strong
        terrestrial absorption. To account for the instrument profile I convolved
        model spectra with a Gaussian kernel matched to the reported resolution. After
        these corrections I found that water vapor remains a robust detection while
        carbon monoxide is detected at lower significance. I considered alternative
        explanations such as high altitude clouds which can reduce feature amplitudes
        and noted that degeneracies between temperature and abundance can produce
        similar spectral shapes. I conclude that the data support the presence of
        water vapor with moderate confidence and that follow up observations at higher
        spectral resolution and broader wavelength coverage would help confirm weaker
        species and break parameter degeneracies. I include suggestions for improved
        analysis such as using an MCMC sampler to better map parameter covariances
        and exploring different continuum placement strategies to quantify that source
        of uncertainty.</p>
      feedback:
        comment: Solid and methodical analysis. You documented key steps clearly and
          identified important systematics. For improvement, justify your choice of
          polynomial order for continuum normalization and expand the uncertainty
          estimation using MCMC or nested sampling. Include a brief sensitivity test
          showing how cloud top pressure would alter the best fit composition.

        would acquire subsurface samples from near surface brine pockets. Detection
        strategies focus on combined geochemical and isotopic analysis for organic

        would include a miniaturized mass spectrometer, a tunable laser spectrometer,
        and a microfluidic lab for wet chemistry. Observational methods emphasize
        coordinated orbiter relay and time limited penetrator operations to maximize

    - body: <p>Extremophiles demonstrate a remarkable range of adaptations that allow
        life to persist under conditions once thought to be incompatible with biology.
        For this case study I focus on halophilic archaea and the radiation resistant
        bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans. Halophiles maintain osmotic balance through
        accumulation of compatible solutes and specialized ion pumps, and their proteins
        exhibit surface charge distributions that enhance stability in high salt.
        In contrast, D radiodurans relies on highly efficient DNA repair systems,
        multiple genome copies, and antioxidant defenses that mitigate damage from
        ionizing radiation. At the membrane and protein level, extremophiles often
        employ unique lipid compositions and chaperone networks that preserve structure
        under extremes of temperature, pH, or salinity. Molecular adaptations such
        as extremozymes provide biochemical activity in harsh conditions and are of
        interest for biosignature detection because they affect metabolite and gas
        fluxes in an environment. From an astrobiology perspective these strategies
        expand the range of environments considered habitable and inform target selection
        for missions. For example, high salt brines on icy worlds could support halophile
        like metabolisms, and robust DNA repair pathways suggest that genetic material
        could persist in episodically hostile settings. The case study synthesizes
        findings from two primary research articles and evaluates how specific adaptations
        alter the prospects for detection of life on other worlds.</p>

  - body: 'Understanding biosignatures requires integrating observations with models
      of planetary climate and photochemistry. Robust biosignatures are spectral or
      temporal signals that are most plausibly explained by biological activity rather
      than abiotic chemistry. Common targets include molecular oxygen O2, ozone O3,
      methane CH4 in chemical disequilibrium, and secondary indicators such as surface
      pigments or volatile organics.


      False positives can arise from photochemical production, volcanic outgassing,
      or surface redox processes, so placing candidate signals in a climate and geochemical
      context is essential. Key climate factors include stellar irradiation, greenhouse
      gases like CO2 and H2O, planetary albedo, atmospheric pressure and circulation.
      Coupled general circulation models and photochemical simulations help predict
      whether biosignature gases can accumulate and reach observable altitudes.


      Observational approaches include transit spectroscopy, direct imaging and thermal
      phase curve analysis, each sensitive to different altitude ranges, clouds and
      surface conditions. Clouds and aerosols may obscure or mimic spectral features,
      so multi wavelength, time resolved and high signal to noise data improve confidence.
      Combining multiple lines of evidence within a rigorous framework reduces false
      positives and yields a more complete assessment of habitability for target exoplanets.'

    submissions:
    - body: '<p>During a regional land use planning initiative I observed a practical
        example of Indigenous knowledge informing environmental decisions. Local planners
        were consulting with a First Nations community about a wetland restoration
        project. Community Elders shared observations about species arrival times
        and subtle shifts in plant phenology that they had tracked over decades. They
        explained how certain moss beds signal groundwater levels while particular
        berry ripening patterns indicate soil health. Planners had initially focused
        on hydrological models and satellite data, but community knowledge highlighted
        near surface indicators that the models missed.</p>

        <p>I noticed two main outcomes from this interaction. First, project priorities
        shifted to include smaller scale monitoring plots in key locations identified
        by the Elders. Second, the restoration timeline was adjusted to align with
        traditional seasonal activities, which improved participation and reduced
        disruption to cultural practices. However, I also witnessed tensions. Meeting
        agendas and reporting templates were shaped by the funding agency and did
        not leave space for storytelling or oral history, which limited how the community
        could present its knowledge. This created a power imbalance where scientific
        data retained primacy in decision making despite the clear value of Indigenous
        observations.</p>

        <p>Reflecting on the experience, three strategies seem important. One, co
        design monitoring frameworks so they incorporate community indicators alongside
        scientific metrics. Two, fund and schedule meetings in ways that respect cultural
        protocols and seasonal rhythms. Three, create reporting formats that validate
        oral histories and qualitative knowledge as evidence. Ethically, informed
        consent and data sovereignty must guide any knowledge sharing. Communities
        should retain control over how their observations are used and credited.</p>

        <p>In sum, integrating Indigenous knowledge improved ecological understanding
        and social legitimacy in the project, but only when governance processes adapted
        to recognize different ways of knowing. Full integration requires attention
        to power, to ethical governance of knowledge, and to restructuring standard
        project practices so that Indigenous expertise is not an add on but a foundational
        element of design and evaluation.</p>

    - body: <p>During a weekend field visit to a nearby coastal reserve managed in
        partnership with a local Indigenous community I recorded notes on vegetation
        patterns wildlife signs and human land use. I focused on observing indicators
        of traditional ecological knowledge in land care practices such as controlled
        burning plant harvesting zones and indicators of habitat health. I also made
        note of governance markers community led restoration activities and interactions
        between rangers and visitors.</p><p>In the report I describe the methods used
        to collect data including timed transect walks photo documentation systematic
        note taking and a short semi structured conversation with a community ranger.
        I reflect on ethical protocols followed such as seeking permission following
        local guidance and planning to share findings with community partners. I link
        field observations to course concepts on Indigenous land rights co management
        adaptive governance and ecological stewardship drawing on specific readings
        and lecture materials.</p><p>The report concludes with a critical reflection
        on positionality methodological limitations and practical recommendations
        for supporting community led initiatives while respecting Indigenous decision
        making authority. I include maps photographs and a brief appendix of observational
        notes to support analysis.</p>
      feedback:
        comment: Strong and practical field notes that show careful attention to ethical
          practice and governance context. For improvement add more explicit citation
          of course readings and expand on how specific concepts informed your recommendations.

    - body: <p> For this assignment I drafted a restorative environmental management
        proposal focused on rehabilitating a degraded river corridor on unceded territory.
        The plan was co developed with community advisors and centers Indigenous knowledge
        systems in site assessment and decision making. Key elements include negotiated
        co management arrangements that affirm land rights, community led monitoring
        protocols that specify data ownership and access, culturally appropriate restoration
        actions such as riparian planting and reinstatement of traditional species,
        and a phased timeline with local employment and training objectives. The proposal
        links governance recommendations to existing legal frameworks and suggests
        a framework for free prior and informed consent and adaptive governance. I
        reflected on the tensions between academic timelines and community priorities
        and proposed strategies to sustain long term stewardship. </p>

        I will draw on scholarly literature community reports and interviews where

      \ as they relate to environmental decision making\n The page emphasizes Indigenous\
      \ governance models and knowledge systems that guide stewardship and resource\

      \ topics covered include community led mapping, collaborative environmental\
      \ assessments, co management agreements, and mechanisms for enforcement and\
      \ dispute resolution\n The entry outlines research methods and ethical protocols\
      \ for working with Indigenous communities including free prior and informed\
      \ consent, benefit sharing, and reflexive researcher positionality\n Case studies\
      \ illustrate recent claims and governance innovations across jurisdictions to\
      \ show how recognition of rights can support ecological integrity and community\
      \ wellbeing\n Suggested learning activities include guest lectures by Indigenous\
      \ leaders, field based land visits, participatory mapping exercises, and policy\

    - text: Choosing the right license is critical for reuse. For instance CC BY encourages
        wide reuse with attribution while ODbL requires derived datasets to remain
        open. For historical place based datasets we also need to remove or aggregate
        sensitive points to protect privacy before releasing data.

    - text: One risk I have seen is incompatible licenses when combining multiple
        data sources. If a base dataset has a share alike requirement it can force
        the whole product to adopt that restriction. That can limit publication options

        city addresses. I first inspected the raw strings for common issues such as
        inconsistent street abbreviations stray punctuation and missing town names.
        I standardized abbreviations to a single format and added the county when
        it was missing to improve geocoder matches. I then ran batches through two
        services Nominatim and a commercial geocoder and compared results to identify
        discrepancies.</p>

        <p>For each address I recorded the returned coordinates the reported confidence
        or rank and any notes about parsing failures. When results appeared implausible
        I checked historical maps and the original archival source to verify whether
        the location had changed or whether a transcription error was likely. For
        example one entry with an old street name matched to a modern different street
        so I flagged that match and provided the historical street name in a notes
        field.</p>

        <p>I mapped the successful matches in QGIS using simple symbology to show
        high and low confidence results. The map reveals clusters of high confidence
        geocoding in commercial districts and more uncertain locations in peripheral
        neighborhoods where historical naming conventions were inconsistent. The CSV
        export includes original address the cleaned address latitude longitude geocoder
        source and a confidence label.</p>

        <p>In my reflection I discuss trade offs between automating cleaning and manual
        inspection and note that combining multiple services with reference to primary
        sources yields the most reliable results for historical research. I also reflect

    - body: '<p>I created a choropleth showing median household income by census tract
        for

        our study region. I began by normalizing income values to account for tract

        population differences and by removing tracts with zero or missing values

        to avoid spurious classification. I tested three classification schemes

        including equal interval, quantiles, and Jenks natural breaks. After visual

        comparison I selected quantiles for the main map because it produced more

        legible class breaks in areas with clustered income values, while also

        creating a balanced distribution of map colors.</p>


        <p>For the color palette I selected a sequential scheme from a color safe

        set and verified color contrast for common types of color deficiency. I

        avoided using a single hue with heavy saturation that can exaggerate small

        differences. I included a clear legend with class ranges and added labels

        that note the normalization method used. I also added inset maps and small

        multiples showing alternative classifications so viewers can see how bin

        choice affects perceived spatial patterns.</p>


        <p>During critique I reflected on three main issues. First, the modifiable

        areal unit problem can make tracts with large area but small population seem

        more prominent than they should. Second, raw choropleth shading can imply

        uniformity within polygons and hide within area heterogeneity. Third, choice

        of class breaks can either highlight or obscure local inequalities depending

        on where bins fall.</p>


        <p>To address these concerns I recommend supplementing the choropleth with

        a density based or dasymetric visualization for population normalized fields,

        and with point based proportional symbols for sampled observations when

        available. I also argue for publishing the data processing steps and class

        break values alongside the map so readers can reproduce the result and judge

        the influence of design choices. Overall the project reinforced how carto

        principles and ethical considerations must guide spatial representation to

        avoid misleading conclusions.</p>

    - body: <p>For this project I assembled route data from historical maps and archival
        shipping logs to construct a spatial network for a coastal trade region in
        the nineteenth century. After georeferencing scanned charts I extracted linear
        features for primary routes and normalized overlaps from different map editions.
        Nodes represent major ports and junctions while edges represent documented
        route segments. Edge weights combine distance and reported frequency of voyages
        so that commonly used links have higher weight in analyses. I used QGIS for
        digitizing and initial topology checks then exported the network to Python
        where I used NetworkX to compute degree centrality betweenness centrality
        and eigenvector centrality. I also ran a simple community detection algorithm
        to identify clusters of tightly connected ports and compared those clusters
        to known political and economic zones of the period. Results show several
        hubs that align with documented market centers as well as a few intermediary
        nodes whose high betweenness suggests they functioned as brokers in the transport
        system. I discuss how data uncertainty from ambiguous route traces and inconsistent
        naming was addressed by cross checking with secondary sources and by implementing
        conservative node merging rules. The submission includes two maps showing
        the raw geospatial data and the network overlay plus a short code snippet
        that illustrates how edge weights were calculated and how centrality measures
        were exported for interpretation. In the conclusion I reflect on the benefits
        and limits of network approaches for historical inquiry and propose directions
        for expanding the temporal scope of the model.</p>

  pages:
  - body: 'Historical GIS and Spatial Humanities Workshop provides hands on training
      in geospatial methods for historians and scholars in the humanities.   Participants
      will learn georeferencing of historical maps, digitization of archival sources,
      spatial network analysis, and temporal mapping techniques.   The workshop emphasizes
      open source tools such as QGIS and command line libraries, while demonstrating
      best practices for data management, metadata creation, and reproducibility.   Interactive
      lab sessions guide students through building layered historical maps, performing
      spatial queries, and integrating textual and spatial data for narrative analysis.   Ethical
      considerations and community engaged scholarship are central topics, including
      discussions of provenance, representation, and responsible publication of geospatial
      data.   By the end of the workshop participants will complete a reproducible
      project and gain practical skills to apply GIS methods in their own research

        sample rooms using both Sabine and Eyring approaches and discusses the implications
        for acoustic design in the context of Architectural Acoustics and Urban Soundscapes
        280.</p>


        <p>Room 1 small office

        Volume V equals 45 m3

        Total surface area S equals 60 m2

        Assumed average absorption coefficient alpha bar equals 0.35

        Sabine absorption A equals S times alpha bar equals 60 times 0.35 equals 21
        sabins

        Sabine RT equals 0.161 times V divided by A equals 0.161 times 45 divided
        by 21 equals 0.345 seconds

        Eyring RT equals 0.161 times V divided by negative S times ln of one minus
        alpha bar

        One minus alpha bar equals 0.65

        ln of 0.65 equals negative 0.4308

        Denominator equals negative 60 times negative 0.4308 equals 25.848

        Eyring RT equals 0.161 times 45 divided by 25.848 equals 0.280 seconds

        The two estimates are close for a moderately absorptive small room</p>


        <p>Room 2 medium classroom

        Volume V equals 300 m3

        Total surface area S equals 250 m2

        Assumed average absorption coefficient alpha bar equals 0.15

        Sabine absorption A equals 250 times 0.15 equals 37.5 sabins

        Sabine RT equals 0.161 times 300 divided by 37.5 equals 1.288 seconds

        Eyring approach

        One minus alpha bar equals 0.85

        ln of 0.85 equals negative 0.162

        Denominator equals negative 250 times negative 0.162 equals 40.5

        Eyring RT equals 0.161 times 300 divided by 40.5 equals 1.192 seconds

        Both methods give similar results with Eyring slightly lower due to accounting
        for multiple reflections</p>


        <p>Room 3 large worship hall

        Volume V equals 8000 m3

        Total surface area S equals 2500 m2

        Assumed average absorption coefficient alpha bar equals 0.05

        Sabine absorption A equals 2500 times 0.05 equals 125 sabins

        Sabine RT equals 0.161 times 8000 divided by 125 equals 10.304 seconds

        Eyring approach

        One minus alpha bar equals 0.95

        ln of 0.95 equals negative 0.0513

        Denominator equals negative 2500 times negative 0.0513 equals 128.25

        Eyring RT equals 0.161 times 8000 divided by 128.25 equals 10.049 seconds

        Very long reverberation is predicted which would affect speech intelligibility
        and require targeted absorption to reduce low frequency decay</p>


        <p>Discussion and design implications

        The examples show that Sabine and Eyring give similar RT estimates when average
        absorption is moderate or low, with Eyring often slightly lower for nonideal
        absorption distributions. For design the frequency dependence of absorption
        coefficients is critical. Materials that absorb well at high frequencies may
        not control low frequency decay. In the classroom case a target RT around
        one second supports speech clarity. For the worship hall a target around two
        to three seconds for music might be desired, so interventions such as absorbent
        banners, heavy curtains, or tuned resonant absorbers at low frequencies would
        be necessary. Also room geometry and diffusion play a role in perceived acoustics
        beyond RT alone. Assumptions in these calculations include uniform absorption
        distribution and diffuse field conditions which may not hold in highly irregular
        rooms. Evidence based design should include frequency dependent measurements
        or simulations and in situ testing after construction.</p>


        <p>Conclusion

        Using both Sabine and Eyring methods provides a quick assessment of reverberation
        tendencies and highlights the need for frequency selective treatments and
        room specific strategies in architectural acoustic design.</p>

        and reflection from hard surfaces amplified perceived loudness. Proposed interventions
        include targeted absorptive panels on the concourse ceiling, directional speakers

    - body: <p>I selected a mixed housing street that borders a busy arterial and
        a small commercial strip. Baseline measurements were taken with a Class 2
        sound level meter at three representative receptor points during morning rush
        hour and evening peaks to capture typical variability. The proposal recommends
        a layered strategy that combines low noise asphalt surfacing on the arterial,
        3 meter vegetated berms with integrated sound absorbing panels where right
        of way allows, targeted facade and window upgrades for the worst affected
        buildings, and local traffic calming to reduce pass by noise. I estimate expected
        insertion losses based on barrier geometry and material insertion loss values

        on location. The document includes an implementation schedule, a preliminary

    - body: <p>For my soundscape design concept I focus on a small public plaza near
        a busy transit hub. The objective is to transform the space into a calm auditory
        refuge while preserving cues that aid wayfinding and social interaction. The
        design balances masking of intrusive noise with introduction of curated sound
        events that support rest and conversation. Key elements include soft water
        features tuned to low frequencies to cover traffic rumble, modular seating
        with integrated acoustic panels, and a schedule of periodic ambient performances
        that use natural sound samples and low level instrumentation.</p><p>Acoustic
        strategies are driven by measurements of existing sound pressure levels and
        frequency content. Materials are selected for both absorption and scattering
        to reduce reflections that create loud flutter in the mid frequencies. Vegetation
        is used as a diffusion element and to host small hidden speakers for spatialized
        playback. The design also considers accessibility by ensuring that important
        acoustic signals such as announcements remain clear through directional speaker
        placement and selective equalization.</p><p>Community engagement is part of
        the plan. Local users will help select the palette of sounds and provide feedback
        during a pilot phase. Evaluation metrics include perceived calm measured by
        survey, objective reductions in peak level events, and intelligibility scores
        for intended announcements. The concept aims for an adaptive approach that
        can be tuned after monitoring to meet both acoustic performance targets and
        social needs.</p>

    - body: <p>This lab documents measurements of material absorption and acoustic
        scattering performed in the university acoustics lab. Samples were mounted
        in the impedance tube to obtain normal incidence absorption coefficients across
        octave and third octave bands from 125 Hz to 4000 Hz. Additional measurements
        were taken in a reverberant test volume to estimate random incidence absorption
        and to observe scattering contributions at higher frequencies. Microphone
        calibration and background noise levels were recorded before each run. Data
        processing was performed in Python using a transfer function method for the
        impedance tube and energy decay fitting for the reverberant measurements.
        Results include tabulated absorption coefficients, frequency plots, and an
        assessment of measurement uncertainty. Discrepancies between measured and
        theoretical values are discussed with reference to material porosity, sample
        mounting leaks, and nonideal chamber conditions. Recommendations for improving
        measurement repeatability and for selecting materials in urban soundscape
        applications are provided.</p>

        sized lecture room. Measurements used an exponential sine sweep played from
        a calibrated omnidirectional loudspeaker and recorded with a class 1 measurement
        microphone at multiple listener positions. Impulse responses were extracted
        and processed to derive RT60 estimates using the Schroeder integration method,
        early decay time, and clarity indices. Background noise levels were measured
        with A weighted SPL readings during occupied and unoccupied conditions. Analysis
        was performed with Room EQ Wizard and custom scripts in Python to compute
        spectral decay and octave band values. Results indicate a mid frequency RT60
        of approximately 0.9 seconds and elevated low frequency reverberation that
        may affect speech intelligibility. Recommendations include targeted bass absorption
        behind the stage and improved diffusors near reflections to improve clarity.

  - body: 'Room acoustics focuses on how sound behaves inside enclosed spaces and
      how design choices affect perception. It covers fundamental concepts such as
      sound absorption, diffusion, reflection, and resonance, plus measurement methods
      used to quantify room response. Practical topics include estimating reverberation
      time, controlling low frequency modes with bass trapping, and using absorptive
      and diffusive surfaces to balance clarity and warmth. Soundscape design extends
      these ideas into contextual strategies for composing interior and exterior auditory
      environments, considering source placement, masking strategies, and the role
      of background sound in wellbeing and functionality. The page also outlines measurement

        side stories while using an interactive web map for worldbuilding details.
        The podcast can introduce lore and character perspectives that are optional

    - text: My proposal focuses on branching short form video scenes paired with an
        online codex that updates based on player choices. That way a mobile game
        handles interactivity while social clips seed interest and the codex preserves
        canonical outcomes.
      user: main_user
    - text: One strategy is to center the transmedia arc on a peripheral character
        who can believably move between formats. Use episodic webcomics for visual
        beats and location based AR tasks at public events to create community driven
        reveals.

    - body: <p> I chose to write about an early morning fish market by the docks where
        the air tasted of salt and fried dough and the sun turned the wet planks into
        ribbons of light The narrator slips between stalls noting textures and smells
        to reveal their past instead of telling it The scene relies on tactile imagery

        a linear plot I used close focalization to convey the characters anxiety and
        then widened the scope to show how the market responds to them The assignment

        environmental cues imply social history and economic stress This forced me
        to consider how metaphors and sensory verbs can carry exposition without breaking
        immersion The result is a layered scene that uses sound and touch to show
        memory and motion while sight anchors the timeline</p>

        linear green corridor that runs parallel to the river and links three public
        nodes a market square, a waterside plaza, and a community garden. Streets
        are arranged in a modified grid with permeable lanes for pedestrians and bikes
        and a single shared transit spine for electric shuttles and service vehicles.
        Ground floors along main routes are reserved for mixed use shops and workshops
        while upper floors provide modular residential units that can adapt to changing
        household sizes. Stormwater is routed through bioswales and tiered retention
        basins that double as play areas and seasonal wetlands. Utilities follow a
        distributed model with microgrids and district heating to improve resilience
        and reduce single points of failure. Social resilience is supported through
        a network of communal courtyards and a public workshop that hosts skill sharing
        and maintenance training. My narrative also sketches scenarios of growth where
        infill is guided by strict height limits and mandatory green percentage to
        preserve light and airflow. The plan aims to be walkable, climate adaptive,

        city of Irondell. Mara occupies multiple overlapping roles she is a trader
        a patron of local artisans and an informal mediator between river communities.
        Her economic role gives her privileged access to scarce dyed fiber and trade
        routes which she leverages to support a network of craftswomen who in turn
        supply her distinctive wares. Socially she acts as a broker connecting inland
        producers with river markets which creates dependencies but also reciprocal
        obligations. Ecologically the river basin niche is central to her identity
        seasonal floods determine harvests and transport and thus shape the timing
        of her trade and social rituals. Drawing on social network ideas from class
        I see Mara as a central node whose ties increase resilience in her circle
        but also create single points of failure if her position is undermined. Her
        multiple roles produce narrative tension when resource shocks force her to
        choose between personal loyalty and broader market survival. Mapping her relationships
        reveals potential plot beats where alliances shift and where ecological change
        forces role renegotiation. This analysis highlights how role complexity can
        drive both character development and world scale dynamics. </p>

    - body: '<p>I present a timeline centered on the archipelago nation of Lysara
        to show how successive innovations altered daily life and political structures.
        The timeline begins with the invention of the windglass harvester in Year
        0, an early device that converted ambient winds into mechanical energy and
        transformed coastal agriculture. By Year 45 modular aqueduct networks allowed
        inland settlements to expand, creating new urban centers with distinct governance
        needs. The steamless foundries of Year 112 introduced low heat metallurgy
        that enabled finer tools and lightweight structures, which in turn supported
        the development of rapid courier lanes and early telegraphic signaling in
        Year 130.</p>

        <p>Mid timeline entries focus on information and mobility. The year 217 saw
        the diffusion of mnemonic tapes, affordable mnemonic storage that shifted
        artisanship from oral apprenticeship to recorded processes. This accelerated
        craft standardization but also produced new social stratifications between
        tape keepers and unaffiliated workers. In Year 304 the invention of the tidewheel
        docks standardized long distance shipping schedules and decentralized trade
        hubs, empowering regional guilds and weakening central control.</p>

        <p>Later innovations include Year 412''s biolumen cultivation, an ecological
        technology for lighting that reduced reliance on imported fuel and enabled
        24 hour industry in coastal towns. Year 521 marked the emergence of networked
        cartography, a set of mapping protocols that combined civic data with citizen
        annotations. This created unprecedented visibility into public resources but
        also opened surveillance possibilities that elites exploited to monitor dissent.</p>

        <p>My reflective synthesis ties these shifts to three recurring dynamics.
        First, access and distribution of a technology determine whether it consolidates
        power or diffuses autonomy. Second, innovations that ease production generally
        reconfigure labor but rarely eliminate scarcity without deliberate policy.
        Third, cultural narratives about novelty influence adoption speed; inventions
        framed as restoring tradition meet less resistance than those framed as radical
        rupture.</p>

        <p>I conclude with recommendations for worldbuilders using this model: specify
        who controls initial production, outline feedback loops between invention
        and governance, and consider unintended ecological and social consequences
        when forecasting later eras. The timeline thus serves both as a historical
        scaffold and as a design tool for interactive narratives that explore the
        tensions between progress and equity.</p> '

    - body: <p> I composed an origin myth titled The River of Mirrors in which a community
        learns to read reflections to discern past mistakes and future possibilities.
        The story centers on a mediator figure who returns lost voices to the people
        after teaching them ritual listening. In the analysis I examine how the narrative
        uses common mythic motifs such as the mediator and the sacred landscape and
        how these motifs function to enforce social norms and transmit ecological
        knowledge. I compare the tale to functionalist ideas about myth sustaining
        social cohesion and to symbolic approaches that emphasize meaning making.
        I also discuss how the myth could function in interactive narrative by offering
        branching rituals and memory based mechanics that reveal different community
        histories depending on player choices. The submission includes the full myth
        text followed by a critical commentary of approximately six hundred words

  - Narrative Worldbuilding Techniques
  pages:
  - body: 'Mythmaking is not merely the crafting of gods and monsters but the deliberate
      shaping of recurring patterns of meaning that players can discover and inhabit.
      In interactive story design those patterns should be integrated into mechanics
      environments and dialogue so that narrative emerges from both authored beats
      and player action. Strong myths offer motifs symbolic rules and stakes that
      set expectations while allowing room for surprise and reinterpretation. Designers
      must balance scripted set pieces with systems that enable emergent play branching
      consequences and communal storytelling. Ethical worldbuilding asks whose myths
      are amplified how power and trauma are handled and how borrowed cultural elements
      are transformed with care. Iterative prototyping and diverse playtesting help
      reveal how myths operate in practice and prevent stereotypes from calcifying
      into background assumptions. Treating myth as a flexible design resource rather
      than a fixed canon lets creators build interactive stories that feel resonant
      adaptive and responsive to player agency.

      Botany and Crime Scene Ecology 340 this Friday April 18 at 10 AM. Meet at the
      west entrance of the Biological Sciences building. We will carpool to the riparian
      survey site and plan to return by 4 PM. Please bring waterproof boots, long
      pants, a field notebook, pencil, a plant press if you have one, and a packed
      lunch. Wear sturdy closed toe shoes and be prepared for mud and insects. We
      will practice sample collection and chain of custody procedures used in class.
      If you need a ride or have accessibility needs please contact the instructor
      by Wednesday. Attendance is required for full credit. In case of heavy rain
      the trip will be postponed to the following Friday and a notice will be posted
      on the course page. Ask any questions below and we will respond before the trip.

    - text: I would prioritize seed and pollen sampling from soil layers and from
        clothing or footwear. In urban settings the mix of ornamental species and
        windborne pollen can help place a body or item at a specific location. For
        example, finding seeds from a nearby landscaping shrub on a suspect shoe could
        link them to a particular block.
      user: abigail@ualberta.ca
    - text: My plan would focus on documenting root disturbance and photographing
        root architecture before sampling. Root regrowth patterns can indicate how
        long a disturbance has been present. I would couple that with soil compaction
        measures and a note of nearby plant species to support a timeline estimate.
      user: main_user
    - text: I think lichen and moss colonization on exposed surfaces is often overlooked
        in urban scenes. Measuring growth bands and comparing to reference rates from
        the area can give minimum post disturbance intervals. An example is estimating
        when a piece of plywood was placed over soil based on lichen cover development.
      user: terrance@ualberta.ca
    - text: For me, urban tree bark and insect plant interactions are useful. Bark
        abrasions with transferred plant material can show contact, and herbivore
        or sap feeder activity on nearby plants can indicate how long a body has been
        in place relative to seasonal insect activity.

    - body: <p> A field report based on observations at a small wooded decomposition
        plot highlighted several notable insect plant interactions. I observed that
        patches of vegetation adjacent to the carrion showed changes in vigor and
        species composition compared to control plots. Certain plants near the decomposing
        material displayed enhanced leaf turgor and greener coloration, likely due
        to localized nutrient enrichment from leachate. This observation connects
        to course material on nutrient pulses and how decomposition can create hotspots
        of nitrogen and phosphorus that temporarily boost plant growth. </p><p> Additionally,
        I noted increased herbivore activity on plants surrounding the site, possibly
        attracted indirectly by the increased nutrient content. There were also differences
        in volatile organic compound profiles near the carrion, inferred from insect
        behavior rather than direct chemical analysis. Blow flies and other necrophagous
        Diptera were abundant on the carcass, while certain flower visiting insects
        were more frequent on nearby plants, suggesting that carrion associated VOCs
        can influence insect plant interactions by altering pollinator behavior. This
        ties to lectures on olfactory cues and insect attraction. </p><p> From a forensic
        perspective, these interactions can affect decomposition rates and insect
        succession, which in turn influence postmortem interval estimates. Plant responses
        such as accelerated growth can also be markers of past decomposition activity
        in clandestine graves. I connect these observations to successional theory
        and the role of microhabitat modification by decomposers. Overall this assignment
        reinforced how plant physiology, insect behavior, and microbial decomposition
        are interconnected at crime scenes and why multidisciplinary observation improves
        forensic interpretations. </p>

    - body: <p>I analyzed a set of willow leaf samples collected near an agricultural
        field after local reports of off target spray damage. The objective was to
        determine whether residues of common herbicides and insecticides were present
        in tissues at concentrations that could indicate recent exposure. Samples
        were collected using clean gloves and solvent rinsed tools and placed in sealed
        amber glass vials. Each vial was labeled with a unique sample number and chain
        of custody form entries were made at the time of collection. Samples were
        kept on ice and transferred to the lab within four hours.</p><p>In the laboratory
        I followed an extraction protocol based on solid phase extraction followed
        by cleanup to reduce matrix interferences. Extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography
        with mass spectrometry and by liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass
        spectrometry for polar and non polar analytes respectively. Method blanks,
        matrix spikes, and laboratory control samples were included to assess contamination
        and recovery. A certified reference material was run to verify instrument
        performance. Results showed detectable levels of two organophosphate metabolites
        and trace amounts of a glyphosate derivative in leaf tissue. Reported concentrations
        were above the method limit of quantitation for those analytes.</p><p>Interpreting
        these results requires careful consideration. Plant uptake pathways, timing
        since exposure, and environmental degradation affect tissue concentrations.
        The presence of metabolites suggests either direct uptake of parent compounds
        with subsequent transformation or exposure to degraded products from the environment.
        Potential confounders include drift from nearby applications, historical contamination
        of soil, or contaminated irrigation water. I discussed these possibilities
        in the report and recommended follow up sampling, including soil and water
        testing, and repeat plant sampling over time to assess trends.</p><p>For forensic
        relevance, chain of custody documentation and method validation are critical.
        I included all laboratory log entries, calibration records, and quality control
        data. I also provided an assessment of uncertainty for reported concentrations
        and noted limits of detection and quantitation. The final section of the report
        addressed how the analytical findings could inform a legal or regulatory investigation,
        and what additional evidence would be required to support claims of intentional
        or negligent contamination.</p>

    - body: '<p> In this submission I describe a practical application of dendrochronology
        to a hypothetical forensic investigation where partially buried timber provided
        information about the timing of site disturbance. I begin with sample collection
        considerations that preserve orientation and context while avoiding contamination.
        Proper recording of cambial side and position is essential since missing sapwood
        can alter the final year estimate. In the lab I outline sanding and microscopic
        preparation techniques that reveal annual ring boundaries and permit accurate
        measurement of ring widths. Crossdating against a regional master chronology
        is the central step for assigning calendar years to rings. I explain pattern
        matching logic used in crossdating and describe how signature events like
        droughts and frost rings improve the confidence of matches. I include a brief
        discussion of wiggle matching with radiocarbon for samples outside existing
        chronologies and the role of wood anatomy for species identification. Limitations
        are also important. I discuss how reused timbers, species growth plasticity,
        and disturbed contexts can introduce error. Finally I present a short case
        analysis where the wood dates narrow the window for when a structure was modified
        and how that temporal information interacts with other forensic evidence.
        The report concludes with best practice recommendations for chain of custody

    - body: '<p>Field sampling was conducted on campus grounds during calm weather
        with clear skies. I deployed adhesive microscope slides and a portable volumetric
        trap at three predefined locations: the north wooded edge adjacent to the
        creek, the central lawn near the lecture building, and the gravel parking
        area on the south side. For each location I recorded GPS coordinates, sampling
        start and end times, temperature, wind speed and recent precipitation. Samples
        were labeled with unique alphanumeric identifiers and logged into the field
        chain of custody form immediately after collection.</p><p>In the lab I processed
        slides using glycerin jelly mounting medium and basic fuchsin staining to
        enhance pollen visibility. Identification was carried out at 400x magnification
        using the course reference key and comparison with the departmental reference
        collection. Counts were made using transect counts across fixed fields of
        view and results were normalized to grains per cubic meter for trap samples.
        The wooded edge yielded a dominance of Quercus and Acer pollen, the lawn site
        showed elevated Poaceae and Plantago grains, and the parking area contained
        a mixed background assemblage with higher proportions of fungal spores and
        disturbed herb taxa.</p><p>Interpretation links the wooded edge assemblage
        to local tree cover and suggests potential transfer of tree pollen onto items
        moved from that area. The grass dominated signal at the lawn supports hypotheses
        about recent pedestrian traffic over turf. Limitations of this sampling include
        the short single day sampling window, potential microclimatic variation between
        points, and the coarse taxonomic resolution for some pollen types. I recommend
        establishing multi day sampling and including adhesive tape lifts from exhibits
        or suspect clothing for direct comparison, and generating side by side photomicrographs
        to support identifications.</p>'

        comment: Strong field documentation and clear chain of custody. Methodology
          is well explained and results are logically interpreted in a forensic context.

          add scale bars to photomicrographs, and expand the discussion on possible

    - body: <p> During a recent field exercise for the course I participated in a
        simulated drowning recovery where we collected tissue and environmental samples
        from two different waterbodies. The report I submitted describes the sampling
        approach used to reduce contamination the steps taken in the lab to isolate
        diatoms and algal fragments and the microscopy methods used for identification
        and quantification. I reflect on problems encountered such as low diatom yield
        and mixed assemblages that made source assignment difficult. The write up
        links these observations to forensic practice by addressing chain of custody
        concerns interpretation limits of diatom matching and the value of combining
        diatom evidence with other ecological indicators like algal pigment profiles
        and environmental DNA. I also suggest procedural improvements for future investigations
        such as paired control sampling more rigorous field blanks and clearer documentation
        of sample handling. </p>

  outcomes:
  - Identification of plant evidence at crime scenes
  pages:
  - body: 'Field investigations in forensic botany demand careful sampling, thorough
      documentation, and constant attention to ecological context. Investigators must
      protect scene integrity while collecting plant material, soil, and other organic
      traces that may link people or objects to a location. Best practices include
      systematic mapping and scaled photography with GPS coordinates, establishing
      transects and quadrats for quantitative sampling, and collecting voucher specimens
      for herbarium confirmation. Maintaining chain of custody for botanical evidence
      is crucial to preserve legal value and to enable laboratory analyses such as
      microscopic examination, pollen assessment, or DNA barcoding. Knowledge of phenology,
      growth rates, taphonomic alteration, and plant interactions with insects and
      microbes can help narrow timelines and reconstruct movement patterns. Field
      records should note weather, substrate conditions, and disturbance indicators,
      while samples must be packaged to prevent contamination and to preserve fragile
      tissues. Effective collaboration with law enforcement, crime scene technicians,
      and laboratory specialists enhances interpretation and courtroom readiness.
      Safety, ethical collecting, and respect for private property and protected species
      are mandatory during all field operations.

        I used a two axis map of influence and interest to place each group and described
        the sources of power that shape outcomes. Developers and vendors hold structural
        power through control of code and data, police leadership holds institutional
        power via deployment decisions, while marginalized communities face constrained
        agency and limited access to appeals. My analysis highlights how feedback
        loops in data collection reproduce bias and how resource allocation decisions
        amplify harms. I propose three interventions: establish participatory governance
        with community seats in oversight, require open documentation and external
        audits of models, and create channels for remediation that restore resources
        to affected communities. Overall the mapping foregrounds redistribution of

    - body: '<p> I selected a recent paper that proposed an algorithm for automated
        content moderation. My goal was to reproduce the primary accuracy and subgroup
        fairness results on the same public dataset. I first cloned the authors code
        base and created an environment with matching library versions. Even with
        the same dependencies I found that a number of hyperparameters were not fully
        specified in the paper, and the data preprocessing steps were described at
        a high level rather than with exact commands. To address this I implemented
        preprocessing scripts that matched the description as closely as possible
        and contacted the authors for clarification about tokenization and label cleaning.
        They shared a script that revealed an undocumented downsampling step that
        materially changed class balance. I reran experiments with and without that
        step to measure its impact. I also set and logged explicit random seeds for
        model initialization and data shuffling. Hardware differences mattered too,
        because GPU nondeterminism slightly changed training traces. </p>

        <p> My reproduced metrics matched the published overall accuracy within a
        few percentage points when I included the same downsampling. However subgroup
        error rates diverged in several cases, and the model performed worse for posts
        from smaller demographic groups. This highlighted how undocumented preprocessing
        and sampling can mask harms to marginalized groups. I recorded all variants,
        added unit tests for data pipelines, and produced a reproducibility checklist
        that lists exact commands, dataset checksums, and seed values. </p>

        <p> Overall this exercise showed that small implementation choices and incomplete
        reporting can lead to different conclusions about fairness. For this course
        the key takeaway is that reproducibility is not only a technical matter but
        also an ethical one, because opacity in research can hide negative impacts
        on vulnerable populations. I conclude with recommendations for authors and
        reviewers to require complete artifacts, clear preprocessing steps, and subgroup
        level results so that social impacts can be assessed reliably. </p>'

        and co design data collection methods. The plan begins with a series of listening
        sessions led by community liaisons to surface concerns and priorities. From
        those sessions we will co create interview guides and focus group protocols
        that reflect local knowledge and avoid technical jargon. </p><p> Data collection
        will prioritize low burden methods and offer multiple modalities for participation
        including oral narratives recorded with consent and written responses for
        those who prefer that format. Community members will be trained and compensated
        as research partners to conduct interviews and assist in preliminary coding.
        Analysis will use collaborative coding workshops where community partners
        and researchers jointly interpret themes and develop memos. We will incorporate
        reflexive practices so that positionality is documented and discussed throughout
        the project. Ethical safeguards include ongoing informed consent procedures,
        clear data governance plans that specify who can access raw data, and options
        for participants to review and request removal of their contributions. The
        dissemination plan centers accessible reporting back to participants in plain
        language briefs, community meetings, and co authored outputs where community
        co authors receive appropriate recognition and authorship rights. Timeline
        and milestones are included in the appendix along with a budget that allocates
        honoraria for community partners and funds for accessible meetings. This plan

        recall and area under ROC curve. I also computed fairness metrics such as
        demographic parity difference equalized odds difference and disparate impact
        across race and gender groups. The logistic regression showed stable overall
        accuracy but larger gaps in false negative rates across groups. The random
        forest improved overall AUC but reduced some fairness gaps after tuning and
        reweighting. I experimented with a post processing threshold adjustment and
        an in processing reweighting method and observed tradeoffs between overall
        utility and group parity. The most effective mitigation combined reweighting
        during training with calibrated thresholds selected for equalized false negative
        rates. I discussed practical implications for deployment including the need
        for transparency stakeholder engagement and continuous monitoring to detect
        distribution shift. For reproducibility I included code notebooks data processing

    - body: <p> The readings for this module examine how surveillance technologies
        are embedded within social and political structures. My reflection focuses
        on three central ideas from the texts. First many authors argue that data
        collection is not neutral but shaped by existing power relations which determine
        what is monitored who is targeted and how data are interpreted. Second algorithmic
        systems often amplify historical biases in datasets which produces unequal
        outcomes for marginalized communities. Third there is a need for institutional
        accountability and participatory governance to address harms arising from
        automated decision making. In the reflection I connect these arguments to
        a local example involving predictive policing tools and consider their implications
        for privacy fairness and civic trust. I close by suggesting concrete policy
        and design interventions such as transparency requirements community oversight
        and impact assessments to mitigate harms. </p>

        for a community resource platform. The proposal identifies potential bias
        sources including imbalanced training data, feedback loops, and unequal exposure.
        It proposes concrete fairness objectives such as demographic parity for exposure
        and minimax regret for utility loss. The methods section outlines data collection
        protocols, preprocessing steps for balancing, algorithmic choices that include
        reweighting and constrained optimization, and a plan for post deployment monitoring.
        Evaluation methods include counterfactual simulations, subgroup accuracy analysis,
        and user centered metrics obtained through surveys. The proposal also discusses
        trade offs between fairness and relevance and offers governance mechanisms
        like transparent reporting and an appeal process to address harms. </p>

      education and civic participation. This page centers algorithmic accountability
      and community equity as core themes of the Critical Algorithms and Social Justice
      300 course. We examine how design choices data practices and deployment contexts
      produce disparate impacts for historically marginalized groups. Students will
      learn methods for auditing models documenting decision pipelines engaging stakeholders
      and advocating for reparative policies. Readings include empirical studies community
      reports and legal analyses that illuminate power relations embedded in automated
      tools. Coursework emphasizes participatory design community consultation and
      transparent reporting as means to redistribute technical expertise and to support
      collective governance of data driven systems. Practical assignments include
      conducting a bias assessment of an open dataset collaborating with a local community
      partner and drafting policy recommendations grounded in equity principles

        For example an autonomous cargo vessel that misinterprets sensor data could
        cause a grounding event with major ecological harm. Clear liability rules

    - body: '<p>In this assignment I propose a secure communication protocol for autonomous
        maritime

        platforms that balances strong security guarantees with the operational constraints

        of open sea deployments. The design goals are confidentiality, integrity,
        authentication,

        and resilience to intermittent connectivity. The protocol uses elliptic curve
        cryptography

        for key agreement to minimize computational overhead, combined with AEAD ciphers
        for

        message protection. A lightweight certificate based identity system is used
        for mutual

        authentication between vessel controllers and shore based control centers.
        For session

        establishment the system performs an authenticated key exchange leveraging
        offline

        provisioned root credentials and short lived session keys to limit exposure
        in case of

        compromise. To handle connectivity interruptions the protocol supports stateless
        resumption

        tokens with sequence numbers and optional replay windows to avoid desynchronization.

        Message formats are compact and avoid verbose headers to reduce bandwidth
        use. The

        threat model includes eavesdroppers, active man in the middle attacks, spoofed
        GNSS

        inputs, and compromised peripheral sensors. Course concepts applied include
        risk assessment,

        layered defense, and the trade offs between security and real time requirements
        in

        autonomous control loops. I evaluate choices such as using AES GCM for authenticated

        encryption versus lighter weight algorithms for constrained devices and justify
        the

        selection based on expected processing capability and latency budgets. I also
        outline

        key management procedures for issuing and revoking credentials while at sea,
        and a

        fallback mode that uses integrity only checks to maintain safety critical
        messaging

        when confidentiality is temporarily infeasible. The protocol diagram and rationale

        are attached in the appendix. Overall the design emphasizes pragmatic security
        that

        aligns with maritime operational realities. </p>

    - body: <p>During our course team exercise I drafted a policy brief on how amendments
        to a regional shipping code could affect liability for autonomous vessel operators.
        I argued that placing primary responsibility on the operator would incentivize
        stronger cybersecurity measures, but peers noted that this could unfairly
        burden technology providers. The debate revealed confirmation bias on both
        sides as each of us favored sources that supported our preferred allocation
        of responsibility. To overcome this, we agreed to include neutral third party
        analyses and to seek precedent from recent arbitration outcomes. This experience
        highlighted the need for structured evidence review and for regulatory proposals
        to include clear provisions for shared responsibility and incident investigation.</p>

    - body: <p> During the final simulation I configured two autonomous vessels and
        one manually piloted ship to transit a narrow channel with a schedule conflict.
        The autonomous systems used different path planning heuristics and collision
        avoidance thresholds. Early in the run one vessel chose an aggressive overtaking
        maneuver causing the other to brake hard and execute an evasive turn. I observed
        oscillatory heading corrections as the planners repeatedly recalculated routes
        in response to the perceived second vessel movements. This led to a near miss
        situation which the simulator flagged for review. In my analysis I identify
        the timing of sensor update cycles and differing prediction horizons as key
        factors. I discuss possible mitigation strategies including harmonizing update
        rates, implementing conservative gap acceptance rules, and adding a shared
        intent broadcast to reduce conflicting maneuvers. The report closes with suggestions
        for testing under varied traffic densities and sensor noise profiles. </p>

    - body: '<p>For this project I developed a hybrid machine learning system for
        collision avoidance on an autonomous surface vessel. The architecture pairs
        a convolutional neural network for visual and range based obstacle detection
        with a recurrent policy network trained via reinforcement learning for trajectory
        planning. I created a diverse simulated dataset combining AIS tracks radar
        returns and lidar point clouds. Data preprocessing included timestamp alignment
        across sensors normalization of input channels and augmentation through random
        rotations jitter and simulated sensor noise. The CNN was pretrained on a generic
        maritime image set then fine tuned on scenario specific frames. The policy
        network was trained in closed loop simulation using a shaped reward that penalized
        near misses and collisions while encouraging smooth energy efficient maneuvers.</p>

        <p>Evaluation used k fold cross validation and a set of held out edge scenarios
        that included abrupt target maneuvers sensor dropouts and confined waterways.
        Key metrics were time to collision minimum separation and false positive rate
        for alerts. The system achieved a mean time to collision improvement of forty
        five percent relative to a rule based baseline and reduced false positive
        alerts significantly. Ablation tests showed the fusion module contributed
        most to robustness under degraded sensor conditions. Failure mode analysis
        revealed performance drops when lidar range was severely limited or when vessel
        dynamics were outside the training envelope. To mitigate these issues I recommend
        integrating model based safety filters formal constraint checks and expanding
        the training set with rare corner cases and recorded field data.</p>

        <p>The report concludes with a discussion of deployment concerns including
        sensor redundancy latency budgets certification pathways and ethical implications
        for autonomous decision making at sea. Future work will focus on sim to real
        transfer methods domain adaptation and formal verification of safety properties.</p>

    - body: <p> This submission outlines a secure onboard network architecture for
        an autonomous surface vessel. The design adopts a multilayer segmentation
        approach separating control systems, sensor networks, operator workstations,
        and business IT. Critical actuators and navigation controllers are placed
        on an isolated control LAN with strictly enforced whitelist rules and hardware
        based access control. Sensors and payload devices occupy dedicated VLANs with
        gateway filtering to limit exposure. A hardened firewall with maritime protocol
        awareness mediates interzone traffic while a dedicated out of band management
        network provides secure administration and recovery paths. Redundancy is achieved
        through dual communication links and redundant gateways to preserve safety
        critical functions. Intrusion detection combines host based agents on critical
        systems and network sensors that monitor for anomalous maritime traffic patterns,
        GPS spoofing signatures, and command injection attempts. Authentication uses
        mutual TLS with a centralized certificate authority and automated certificate
        rotation, supplemented by role based access control and multi factor authentication
        for operator interfaces. Centralized logging and secure time stamping support
        incident investigation, while integrity controls and secure boot protect system
        firmware. The architecture emphasizes defense in depth, minimal attack surface,
        and clear incident response procedures including secure update delivery and
        rollback capabilities. Recommended implementation practices include hardware
        security modules for key storage, regular patching schedules, network traffic
        baselining, and documented recovery drills to ensure resilience during cyber
        incidents. </p>

    - body: '<p>The AIS Spoofing Detection Lab asked students to recreate a spoofing
        event using recorded AIS feeds and to design both signature based and learning
        based detectors. The workflow required collection of AIS messages, normalization
        of timestamps and positions, and extraction of features such as MMSI consistency,
        sudden course changes, improbable speed bursts, and duplicate identity overlaps.
        Students implemented rule based filters to flag obvious anomalies and trained
        a random forest classifier to reduce false positives while preserving detection
        recall.</p>


        <p>Reports presented a clear methods section that described packet parsing
        logic, feature engineering decisions, and the training and validation split
        for model evaluation. Results included precision recall metrics, a confusion
        matrix, and examples of both true positives and false alarms. Code excerpts
        demonstrated how AIS payloads were parsed and how labeled examples were generated
        for supervised learning. The reflection discussed deployment concerns for
        autonomous vessel systems such as latency constraints, bandwidth limits, and
        the impact of false alarms on autonomous navigation decisions. Final recommendations
        covered sensor fusion with radar and ADS B, the use of temporal smoothing,
        and procedures for operator intervention.</p>

      on, scenario driven instruction for securing and testing modern shipboard networks
      and autonomous control platforms

      Students engage with realistic threat simulations including GNSS spoofing, AIS
      manipulation, sensor tampering, and adversarial firmware updates to learn detection,
      mitigation, and forensic techniques

      Lab sessions use virtualized bridge simulators, container based testbeds, and
      hardware in the loop rigs to analyze network traffic, harden OT protocols, and
      validate secure communication channels

      Emphasis is placed on threat modeling, incident response playbooks, secure software
      supply chain practices, and safety oriented risk management tailored to maritime
      contexts

      Assessment includes individual lab reports, team capture the flag style challenges,
      and a final project that proposes and demonstrates a resilience plan for an
      autonomous vessel

      All activities follow strict safety, legal, and data governance guidelines and
      instructors provide reproducible experiment templates, grading rubrics, and
      guidance on collaboration and academic integrity

    - text: I prefer fMRI because it gives good spatial detail that helps identify
        flavor related areas like the insula and orbitofrontal cortex. My proposed
        study would use brief odor and texture stimuli while measuring BOLD responses
        to test whether combined cues produce additive or interactive changes in orbitofrontal
        activity.
      user: monica@ualberta.ca
    - text: I would focus on EEG since it has excellent timing resolution which is
        useful for tracking rapid taste odor integration. A simple design could present
        congruent and incongruent aroma texture pairs and measure event related potentials
        to test if congruence speeds neural integration.
      user: main_user
    - text: fNIRS seems practical for tasting studies because it tolerates movement
        better than fMRI and can be used in more naturalistic feeding situations.
        I would hypothesize that pleasant textures increase prefrontal hemodynamic
        responses when paired with familiar aromas.
      user: terrance@ualberta.ca
    - text: MEG offers strong temporal precision and reasonable spatial localization
        for cortical responses to flavor stimuli. One study idea is to compare neural
        synchrony during multimodal flavor cues to test whether aroma enhances texture
        related network coherence.

    - body: '<p>For my Multisensory Dining Design Project I developed a three course
        experience called Forest Morning that leverages known crossmodal correspondences
        and basic neurobiology of flavor perception to enhance freshness umami and
        sweetness without increasing added sugars or sodium. The concept centers on
        evoking the sensation of a damp early morning forest through a combination
        of cool diffuse green lighting subtle pine and citrus aromatics low frequency
        ambient field recordings and a focus on seasonal textures.</p>

        <p>The menu includes an amuse bouche of moss inspired beet tartlet with whipped
        goat cheese and a citrus mist to accentuate brightness a first course of chilled
        cucumber and green apple consomm might with micro herbs whose plate is served
        on a chilled moss textured surface and finished with a spritz of pine infused
        water and a main course of miso glazed mushroom medley with roasted barley
        and a warm umami broth poured tableside to emphasize retronasal olfaction
        and temperature contrast. Each course manipulates one primary sensory channel
        while holding others constant to isolate effects in the proposed pilot test.</p>

        <p>The experimental protocol is a within subject design with counterbalanced
        conditions. Participants dine in two settings the full multisensory condition
        and a control neutral setting. Primary outcome measures are perceived flavor
        intensity perceived freshness overall enjoyment and willingness to pay. Physiological
        measures include brief heart rate variability segments and galvanic skin response
        to capture arousal differences. Short validated questionnaires measure expectation
        and memory for the meal. Sample size for the pilot is forty participants to
        provide initial effect size estimates.</p>

        <p>Neuroscientific rationale draws on multisensory integration findings showing
        that orbitofrontal cortex integrates gustatory olfactory and visual inputs
        to construct flavor and assign value. Crossmodal correspondences such as high
        pitch associating with brightness and citrus notes enhancing perceived sweetness
        inform our audio choices. Retronasal olfaction and temporal dynamics of aroma
        release are targeted by the broth pour and aromatic spritzes to amplify flavor
        without changing macronutrient content. Texture manipulations aim to engage
        somatosensory pathways that modulate salivation and mouthfeel which in turn
        influence perceived taste.</p>

        <p>Practical considerations include allergy screening pilot testing of aroma
        strength and an itemized materials and timing plan for front of house staff.
        Expected outcomes are increased perceived freshness and enjoyment in the multisensory
        condition with modest physiological markers of engagement. Limitations and
        future directions include longer term field trials and exploring individual
        differences such as sensory sensitivity and cultural background.</p>

    - body: <p>In this case study I examine the pairing of dark chocolate with roasted
        coffee and relate it to neural integration in gustatory and olfactory systems.
        The pairing is commonly perceived as harmonious because both items share overlapping
        volatile compounds and bitter taste components that activate similar receptor
        populations. At the peripheral level, bitter taste receptors and TRP channels
        respond to alkaloids present in both foods. Olfactory input from retronasal
        aroma during mastication converges with taste signals in the orbitofrontal
        cortex where multisensory integration assigns reward value. Dopaminergic signaling
        in the ventral striatum likely reinforces learned preferences formed through
        repeated exposure to this combination. I also consider top down influences
        such as attention and expectation which modulate early sensory processing
        and alter perceived congruence. Based on this framework I propose an experiment
        using fMRI to compare neural responses to the pair versus each item alone
        while measuring subjective pleasantness and predictive coding signals. The
        study would test whether paired presentation leads to enhanced orbitofrontal
        activation and stronger connectivity with the piriform cortex compared to
        single items. If true, this would support the hypothesis that flavor pairing
        effects are driven by integrated sensory representations that boost hedonic
        valuation. Limitations include individual differences in prior exposure and
        genetic variation in taste receptors which should be controlled for. Overall,
        linking receptor level overlap to cortical multisensory integration provides
        a mechanistic account for why certain flavor pairs are perceived as complementary.</p>

    - body: <p>Growing up in a bicultural household I learned early that what is considered
        delicious depends heavily on cultural context. For example my strong preference
        for fermented vegetables developed from repeated exposure to them during family
        meals while several classmates from other regions found those same flavors
        unpleasant. This illustrates associative learning where repeated pairing of
        a flavor with positive social contexts builds hedonic value. I also observed
        that expected temperature and texture alter perceived flavor. A warm spiced
        broth eaten at home tasted more complex and satisfying than a similar broth
        sampled cold at a campus fair. Such differences align with top down modulation
        where expectations and context bias sensory processing in the brain. Predictive
        coding frameworks suggest that cultural schemas determine which sensory features
        are emphasized and how prediction errors lead to preference updates over time.
        Language influences perception as well. When a relative labeled a dish using
        comforting terms the experience was enhanced. Descriptive labels guide attention
        to attributes and shape memory for flavors. Social rituals around sharing
        food provide reinforcement that can amplify liking through social reward mechanisms.
        To test cultural influence empirically I would run a cross cultural experiment
        presenting novel flavored beverages to participants from two culinary backgrounds
        while manipulating contextual cues to be either culturally congruent or neutral.
        Liking ratings combined with neural measures such as EEG could reveal early
        sensory encoding differences and later evaluative processing modulated by
        culture. Behavioral predictions include higher liking and faster positive
        evaluations for congruent context conditions among participants with matching
        cultural exposure. Neural predictions include greater early sensory differentiation
        and enhanced late positive potentials for congruent pairings. In sum cultural
        exposure shapes flavor perception through learned associations expectation
        driven modulation and social reinforcement. Understanding these mechanisms
        helps explain cross cultural variation in food preferences and suggests ways
        to design interventions that broaden acceptance of diverse foods.</p>
      feedback:
        comment: Well reasoned discussion with clear links to course concepts. The
          examples are vivid and the proposed experiment is feasible. For revision
          add more detail on predicted neural signatures and specify which statistical
          tests you would use.

    - body: '<p> This proposal outlines an experiment to test how oral texture alters
        perceived flavor intensity and pleasantness. Hypothesis A is that increased
        mechanical contrast in a food matrix will enhance perceived savory intensity
        for umami rich samples relative to a homogeneous control. Hypothesis B is
        that added crunch will increase overall liking for certain flavors but may
        decrease liking for delicate floral notes.</p>

        <p> Participants will be healthy adults recruited from the university community
        with normal taste and smell function. Stimuli will consist of a base gel matrix
        matched for basic taste concentration and aroma but varied in texture across
        three conditions smooth homogeneous gel lightly particulate gel and added
        crisp inclusions. Samples will be prepared to match temperature appearance
        and basic taste intensity while varying only textural properties. A within
        subject design will be used so that each participant tastes every condition
        in randomized order across sessions.</p>

        <p> Measures will include intensity ratings for basic taste qualities using
        labeled magnitude scales perceived aroma intensity hedonic ratings for liking
        and a brief texture sensitivity task to assess individual differences. Reaction
        time to first bite and bite size will be recorded to probe behavioral changes
        due to texture. Statistical analysis will use repeated measures ANOVA to compare
        ratings across texture conditions and planned contrasts to test the effect
        of particulate versus crisp inclusions. Power analysis prior to data collection
        will guide sample size to detect medium effect sizes with adequate power.</p>

        <p> Predicted results are that added mechanical contrast will amplify savory
        perception due to multisensory integration between oral mechanoreceptors and
        flavor processing networks. This would align with models of texture taste
        interaction and predictive coding accounts of flavor perception. If results
        support the hypotheses implications include guidance for chefs and food developers
        on how to manipulate texture to enhance or suppress specific flavor attributes
        without changing seasoning levels. Limitations include laboratory setting
        and potential individual differences in texture preference that should be
        addressed in follow up work.</p>

        <p> The proposal closes with a timeline for pilot testing final stimulus calibration
        and main data collection along with plans for preregistration and ethical
        review. This design aims to provide evidence on how texture can be harnessed
        to shape flavor experience in culinary and product contexts. </p>

    - body: '<p> Taste memories form a key bridge between sensation and emotion in
        culinary experience. From the first encounter with a specific flavor profile
        to the repeated reinforcement of a dish across contexts, neural traces are
        created that support later retrieval. These traces integrate gustatory input,
        olfactory cues, and contextual signals such as setting and social company.
        Over time, associative learning mechanisms link flavors to outcomes like comfort
        or disgust, shaping long term preferences and avoidance. Understanding the
        biological pathways that underlie encoding and recall of taste memories offers
        chefs and food designers tools to craft lasting positive experiences. </p>

    - body: '<p> Retrieval of taste memories often depends on cues that reactivate
        the original encoding context, such as aroma, texture, or even the time of
        day. The hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, and amygdala coordinate to reconstruct
        a past gustatory episode, biasing choices toward familiar and rewarding foods.
        Experiments using flavor pairing and context manipulation demonstrate how
        easily preferences can shift when retrieval cues are altered. Practical implications
        include menu design strategies and targeted interventions for dietary change
        that leverage memory cues to promote healthier choices. </p>

  - Understanding of neural mechanisms of flavor perception
  pages:
  - body: 'Neurogastronomy examines the neural and cognitive mechanisms that shape
      flavor perception and culinary experience

      It brings together sensory neuroscience, chemosensory physiology, and experimental
      gastronomy to explain how taste, smell, texture, temperature, and vision combine
      in the brain to produce unified flavor percepts

      Core neural regions include the gustatory cortex, the insula, the orbitofrontal
      cortex, and primary olfactory pathways which support multisensory integration,
      reward evaluation, and memory formation

      Common methods span psychophysics and controlled tasting paradigms, neuroimaging
      such as fMRI and EEG, electrophysiology, and computational modeling to link
      behavior to brain function

      Research emphasizes the influence of expectation, attention, cultural context,
      and individual differences on flavor, and it explores how metabolic state and
      genetics modulate chemosensory response

      For culinary practitioners and food scientists these insights offer evidence
      based strategies to design meals that enhance perceived flavor while addressing
      nutrition and safety

      Rigorous methods, transparent reporting, and ethical treatment of participants
      remain essential to translate neuroscientific findings into responsible culinary
      innovation

      You might explore issues like public health and safety, biodiversity and habitat

      Do current policies adequately address these concerns or do we need new rules

        across three urban parks over a four week period Following the protocol from
        class I recorded location notes photographed specimens noted substrate type

        a confidence rating for each identification I then aggregated observations
        to look for spatial and temporal patterns and reflected on sampling biases
        and data quality issues The report links observations to course concepts in
        urban mycology including habitat fragmentation microclimate effects and the
        role of public involvement in monitoring I discuss how uneven observer effort
        and detection probability can skew apparent diversity and suggest concrete
        measures to improve data validity such as repeated visits training sessions
        photo vouchers and expert validation The write up also addresses ethical considerations
        like minimizing disturbance to sensitive sites and sharing results with local

    - body: '<p>My proposal targets the development of a mycelium based acoustic panel
        for busy community centers and transit stations. I selected Pleurotus ostreatus
        as the primary fungal species because it grows quickly on a wide range of
        lignocellulosic wastes and forms a dense interlocking network ideal for structural
        integrity and sound attenuation. For the substrate I plan to blend spent coffee
        grounds with shredded corrugated cardboard to balance available nitrogen and
        carbon and to create a lightweight but cohesive matrix.

        Substrate preparation will focus on reducing competing microbes while retaining
        the organic complexity that supports vigorous mycelial colonization. I will
        use a low temperature pasteurization protocol rather than full sterilization
        to cut energy use and maintain a more accessible workflow for community scale
        production. Inoculation will be performed with grain spawn at approximately
        10 percent spawn to substrate wet weight using aseptic technique in a clean
        workspace. Molds will be fabricated from 3D printed biodegradable polymer
        to create modular panel geometries with internal cavities tuned for acoustic
        absorption.

        Incubation will occur at room temperature with humidity control achieved through
        humidified chambers to promote uniform colonization. Once mycelial run is
        complete the panels will be dried at low heat to halt growth and stabilize
        mechanical properties. Surface finishing will employ a natural wax to add
        water resistance while preserving compostability at end of life.

        Testing will include mechanical evaluation of compression strength and flexural
        modulus to benchmark against cork and standard acoustic foam. Acoustic performance
        will be measured in a small reverberant test setup to determine absorption
        coefficients across a frequency band relevant to speech and urban noise. Environmental
        assessment will include a basic life cycle inventory focusing on energy consumed
        during drying and transport for substrate inputs. I will also conduct a small
        user survey to assess aesthetic acceptance and perceived cleanliness.

        Key challenges include contamination control variability in substrate supply
        and achieving consistent acoustic performance across production batches. Mitigation
        strategies involve simple quality control checks such as incubation of control
        plates periodic moisture checks and developing relationships with local cafes
        to secure a steady stream of spent grounds. I propose a distributed small
        scale production model run in community workshops to reduce transport emissions
        and promote local ownership and skills transfer.

        Ethical and social dimensions will be addressed by documenting safety protocols
        for public workshops including clear signage and training for handling living
        cultures. I will also outline accessibility considerations in panel design
        to ensure products are usable across diverse public spaces.

        The project balances functional targets and circularity. Tradeoffs are acknowledged
        between aggressive drying to improve mechanical stability and the higher energy
        cost that entails. Future work could explore passive solar drying and alternative
        natural binders to enhance durability without undermining end of life compostability.
        This assignment demonstrates a pathway for integrating fungal systems into
        urban material infrastructures through participatory production and attention
        to environmental impact.</p> '

        comment: Strong practical approach with thoughtful substrate choice and testing
          plan. For the next draft add specific sterilization or pasteurization temperatures
          and durations expected and include target acoustic absorption numbers for
          key frequency bands. Cite relevant studies on mycelium composite mechanics
          and outline a basic timeline for community workshops.

        abundant during construction demolition and in aging building stock Spores
        can be inhaled by anyone but they are most dangerous to people with compromised
        immune systems such as patients in hospitals people receiving chemotherapy
        or those with chronic lung conditions</p>

        <p> Surveillance in urban areas needs to combine environmental monitoring
        with clinical reporting Environmental sampling near construction sites hospital
        ventilation systems and composting facilities can detect elevated spore loads
        and point to hotspots Clinical surveillance should include better diagnostic
        capacity in community hospitals and public clinics because delayed recognition
        of invasive disease contributes to poor outcomes Antifungal resistance is
        an emerging concern and monitoring susceptibility patterns in clinical isolates
        is critical to guide therapy and stewardship</p>

        <p> Prevention and mitigation measures include improving ventilation and filtration

    - body: '<p>Over the past semester I focused on characterizing fungal interactions
        with microbiomes sampled from three urban green spaces including a community
        garden a roadside verge and an elevated park bed. I combined surface swabs
        and soil cores with paired culturing and molecular methods using ITS and 16S
        amplicon sequencing. In culture I set up simple dual inoculation plates to
        observe antagonism or facilitation between common fungal isolates and representative
        bacterial isolates recovered from the same sites. Sequencing data were used
        to infer co occurrence patterns and to identify taxa that consistently cooccur
        with dominant saprotrophic fungi.</p>

        <p>Results indicated repeated associations between filamentous saprotrophs
        and specific bacterial groups involved in nitrogen cycling. In vitro co culture
        assays showed that some bacteria inhibited fungal colony expansion while others
        enhanced hyphal density and sporulation. Sequencing based network analysis
        suggested non random assembly with modular structure and several taxa acting
        as connectors between bacterial and fungal modules. These findings align with
        theories of community assembly that emphasize both environmental filtering
        and biotic interactions as drivers of urban microbiome structure.</p>

        <p>Interpreting these outcomes through ecological frameworks clarifies mechanisms
        at play. Niche construction is apparent where fungal decomposition alters
        microhabitats and resource availability making niches for specialized bacteria.
        Facilitation appears in cases where fungal hyphae increase moisture retention
        and create dispersal corridors for certain bacteria supporting mutualistic
        relationships. Conversely competition and antibiosis explain inhibitory interactions
        observed on plates and in negative co occurrence edges in network analysis.
        Functional redundancy among decomposer fungi likely contributes to resilience
        of detrital processing in disturbed urban soils.</p>

        <p>Methodological reflections note limitations such as the snapshot nature
        of the sampling and the challenge of linking correlation to causation. Future
        work should incorporate time series sampling manipulative mesocosms and metatranscriptomics
        to capture functional activity. Understanding these fungal bacterial interactions
        has practical implications for designing urban green infrastructure that enhances
        pollutant breakdown carbon retention and soil health by promoting beneficial
        mycobacterial assemblages.</p>'

    - body: <p>Fungi are a persistent component of indoor microbiomes and their distributions
        are shaped by building materials, ventilation, humidity, and human activity.
        This review summarizes recent findings on fungal colonization patterns in
        homes and public buildings, compares sampling and sequencing methods, and
        discusses how design choices can mitigate unwanted growth. Case studies from
        urban mycology illustrate links between moisture intrusion and species shifts,
        while emerging evidence highlights the role of occupant behavior in dispersal.
        Recommendations include targeted monitoring, material selection, and integrated
        maintenance strategies to reduce health risks and preserve built environment
        integrity.</p>

    - text: I contributed to an urban fungi mapping run last summer using iNaturalist.
        My main takeaway was that clear photo guidance saved a lot of time for experts.
        We asked people to take shots of cap gills or pores and substrate. GPS was
        helpful but often offset in dense canopy. Training sessions reduced misidentifications
        and increased volunteer confidence. One challenge was avoiding foraging risks
        so we emphasized observation only. Happy to help pilot a small protocol for
        the class

  - body: 'Fungal Systems in Urban Environments is an interdisciplinary field that
      examines the roles of fungi in cities from ecological social and infrastructural
      perspectives. Research in this area relies on field surveys controlled experiments
      genetic and microbiome analyses and spatial mapping to document fungal diversity
      function and distribution in urban landscapes. Studies focus on topics such
      as decomposition and nutrient cycling mycelial networks that connect green spaces
      bioremediation of pollutants building material interactions and implications
      for public health. Methodologies emphasize reproducibility transparent data
      sharing standardized sampling protocols and collaboration across biology urban
      planning public health and community groups. Ethical considerations include
      safe handling of isolates consent for sampling on private property avoidance
      of unintentional spread of pathogens and clear communication about risks and
      benefits. Engaging citizens through participatory science projects and educational
      outreach helps broaden datasets improve local stewardship and foster informed
      urban design that integrates fungal insights. This page provides an overview
