        AUV design combines hydrodynamic efficiency structural durability and modular sensor integration to meet mission objectives for coastal mapping and environmental monitoring
        A streamlined hull form paired with precise buoyancy control improves endurance and reduces thruster load during long surveys
        Power system selection and thermal management are critical for extending deployment time while supporting onboard processing and communication tasks
        Robust autonomy including adaptive navigation fault detection and safe mode behaviors allows AUVs to operate reliably in cluttered or changing underwater environments
        Field deployment protocols cover pre deployment checklists sensor calibration mission scripting and contingency plans for recovery and data integrity
        Post mission procedures include data validation battery and hardware inspections and iterative design updates informed by operational lessons

        Urban Soundscape Field Workshop is a hands on session for Urban Soundscape Design 227 that brings students into the field to observe record and analyze everyday acoustic environments
        Participants will learn practical techniques for site selection microphone placement mobile recording and metadata logging while considering ethical issues such as privacy consent and community impact
        The workshop covers basic acoustic measurement methods soundwalking observational annotation and low cost recording setups as well as guidance on file management and data backup
        Students will work in small teams to plan a site visit conduct recordings produce a short interpretive report and present findings in a peer review session
        Safety and respect for public space are emphasized with instructions on situational awareness permissions and minimizing disturbance
        Deliverables include raw audio files annotated field notes a 3 page report and a 10 minute team presentation to be uploaded to the class platform
        Attendance participation and quality of documentation will factor into the assessment

      Page: Neo Assyrian Scribal Hands
    :answer_key:
      :Text: Neo Assyrian scribal hands represent distinct styles of cuneiform writing
        that emerged in northern Mesopotamia during the early first millennium BCE   These
        hands are recognized by consistent choices in wedge angle, stroke order, sign
        proportions, and characteristic ductus that vary between individual scribes
        and institutional schools   Paleographers rely on comparative analysis of
        dated tablets to attribute unsigned fragments to particular scribes or archives
        and to refine chronological sequences for the Neo Assyrian period   Diagnostic
        features include the tilt and length of horizontal wedges, the curvature of
        angled strokes, recurrent ligature patterns, and the relative sizing of common
        signs across administrative, legal, and literary corpora   High resolution
        imaging and quantitative shape analysis complement traditional visual study
        and allow students to test hypotheses about scribal training, apprenticeship
        networks, and regional conventions   In this course students will practice
        safe handling of tablets, sign tracing, transliteration, and statistical attribution
        methods while learning to balance paleographic signals with archaeological
        and provenience data   Thorough documentation and ethical attention to context
        are essential to avoid overreach in attribution and to support responsible
        research on ancient scribal communities
