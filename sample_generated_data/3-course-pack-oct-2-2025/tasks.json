Hands"},"answer_key":{"Text":"Neo Assyrian scribal hands represent distinct styles of cuneiform writing that emerged in northern Mesopotamia during the early first millennium BCE   These hands are recognized by consistent choices in wedge angle, stroke order, sign proportions, and characteristic ductus that vary between individual scribes and institutional schools   Paleographers rely on comparative analysis of dated tablets to attribute unsigned fragments to particular scribes or archives and to refine chronological sequences for the Neo Assyrian period   Diagnostic features include the tilt and length of horizontal wedges, the curvature of angled strokes, recurrent ligature patterns, and the relative sizing of common signs across administrative, legal, and literary corpora   High resolution imaging and quantitative shape analysis complement traditional visual study and allow students to test hypotheses about scribal training, apprenticeship networks, and regional conventions   In this course students will practice safe handling of tablets, sign tracing, transliteration, and statistical attribution methods while learning to balance paleographic signals with archaeological and provenience data   Thorough documentation and ethical attention to context are essential to avoid overreach in attribution and to support responsible research on ancient scribal communities"}}]},{"id":"2fb04821-58a4-4b0e-90b9-2b24882f4582","type":"Information Seeking","answer_type":"Numeric","parameterized_text":"Task: In the course \"[[Course]],\" use the Quizzes page to
