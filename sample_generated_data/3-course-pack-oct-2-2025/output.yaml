    - text: I prefer LBL for missions that need absolute accuracy because fixed seabed
        transponders provide stable reference points. Time of flight ranging combined
        with trilateration gives strong geometry when beacons are well placed. In
        a recent lab trial we achieved meter level accuracy after applying a measured
        sound speed profile.
      user: abigail@ualberta.ca
    - text: The scalability and modularity of LBL appeal to me. You can add or reposition
        transponders to improve dilution of precision for different survey areas.
        For example we set up a triangular array and averaged multiple fixes to reduce
        noise from multipath reflections during a coastal test.
      user: main_user
    - text: I find LBL more robust than USBL when working far from the surface vessel.
        Fixed beacons avoid errors due to ship motion and enable sustained fixes in
        strong currents. In a pipeline inspection exercise the beacons kept localization
        stable while the vessel experienced heading changes.
      user: monica@ualberta.ca
    - text: Combining LBL ranges with onboard sensors in an EKF works well to maintain
        continuous navigation. When beacons drop out the filter still limits drift
        using DVL and IMU data. In one transect we fused ranges with DVL and reduced
        position drift significantly over long distances.

    - body: '<p>During our coastal survey mission simulation I led the planning for
        a short deployment intended to map seafloor features and collect water column
        samples. The plan started with clear objectives and a timeline but as we progressed
        several risks became apparent that required rapid revision of our approach.
        First the predicted current field was more variable than modelled which increased
        the probability of vehicle drift and reduced survey overlap. Second one of
        the primary altimeters showed intermittent noise spikes which degraded altitude
        control near the seabed. Third communication windows with the surface relay
        were shorter than expected due to platform wake interference.</p>

        <p>To address these issues I applied a layered risk assessment. For each failure
        mode I estimated likelihood based on prior runs and sensor diagnostics and
        assessed consequence in terms of data loss mission abort or vehicle damage.
        The altimeter noise was assigned a moderate likelihood and a high consequence
        for low altitude work. For this I recommended switching to a sensor fusion
        approach that weighted velocity and depth sensors more heavily and implemented
        a conservative minimum safe altitude for bottom profiling. For drift risk
        I increased planned overlap and added cross track lines to ensure feature
        coverage even with lateral displacement. For communications I set a contingency
        that buffered high priority telemetry to onboard storage and delayed noncritical
        uploads until stable windows.</p>

        <p>These mitigations map to concepts from the course including redundancy
        design trade offs and probabilistic risk frameworks. The fusion approach reduces
        single sensor dependency and demonstrates how sensor models can be combined
        to improve state estimation. The increased overlap and conservative altitude
        settings illustrate risk acceptance and residual risk management. Documenting
        contingency rules and prelaunch checklists addressed human factor elements
        by reducing reliance on ad hoc decisions during the mission.</p>

        <p>Finally I recommend that future plans include simple quantitative metrics
        such as expected data coverage probabilities and an explicit threshold for
        abort based on cumulative risk score. Running quick Monte Carlo scenarios
        with estimated current variability and sensor noise parameters would allow
        the team to compare alternative track plans before deployment. Overall the
        experience underscored the importance of integrating technical mitigation
        with operational procedures to preserve safety and mission goals.</p>'

    - body: '<p>For this assignment I developed a ballast control approach for a 15
        kg small AUV intended to operate at a nominal depth of 20 meters. The system
        uses a single external ballast bladder with a 1.2 liter capacity and an internal
        fixed trim mass. Buoyancy calculations began with Archimedes principle and
        accounted for compressibility of the bladder volume with depth using a simple
        Boyle like approximation for trapped gas. I sized the bladder to provide a
        positive buoyancy margin of 0.5 kg at the surface and the ability to flood
        to achieve slight negative buoyancy for descent.</p>

        <p>The control logic is a proportional integral controller that commands a
        bidirectional pump to add or remove fluid from the ballast bladder to track
        the target depth. A redundant pressure sensor and an IMU provide depth and
        attitude feedback. In simulation the system responds to a 2 meter depth step
        in about 18 seconds with less than 0.1 meter steady state error when tuned
        for moderate damping. I included simple actuator limits and a watchdog to
        close valves and stop pumping in the event of sensor disagreement.</p>

        <p>Key failure modes considered were bladder leak, pump stall, and valve blockage.
        For a slow bladder leak the control strategy triggers a safe ascent procedure
        using a separate emergency buoyancy chamber that displaces 0.8 liters to guarantee
        positive buoyancy. For pump or valve failures the software switches to a passive
        mode using fixed ballast and surfaces if depth cannot be maintained for a
        predefined timeout. Material selection focused on flexible polymers with proven
        marine compatibility and low gas permeability.</p>

        <p>The submission includes worked examples for two conditions one at surface
        warm water and one at 20 meters cold water that show how density variations
        alter required ballast, a simple CAD schematic of tank placement and piping,
        and plots from the depth control simulation. Overall the design balances simplicity
        and redundancy for a student level project while meeting the performance targets
        for neutral buoyancy and controllable depth regulation.</p>

    - body: '<p>During the project I led the design and testing of a modular docking
        system for a small autonomous surface vehicle used in near shore operations
        The design combined a tapered mechanical guide a compliant bumper system and
        a magnetic latching mechanism to ensure repeatable capture in moderate currents
        Sensor selection prioritized robustness so we used short range sonar for close
        proximity distance estimation a forward looking stereo camera for visual alignment
        and an IMU for attitude stabilization The control approach was a hybrid sequence
        that combined a PID based velocity controller for approach with a small state
        machine that transitioned between search align approach and latch states</p>

        <p>During tank tests we characterized approach behavior by recording position
        error and heading error at 10 hertz Using a motion capture system we measured
        lateral RMS error of 0.25 meters and heading error under 5 degrees at docking
        completion Sea trials revealed additional disturbances from waves and wind
        that increased approach oscillation We mitigated this by adding a low pass
        filter on the heading estimate and tuning the integral term of the PID to
        reduce steady state error The magnetic latch required less alignment tolerance
        than the mechanical bumper however it struggled with biofouling after extended
        deployments which motivated a simple brush and rinse maintenance routine</p>

        <p>Testing procedures included a progressive validation plan starting with
        bench tests of the latch then basin trials followed by controlled near shore
        trials Each stage had pass fail criteria and quantitative metrics such as
        approach success rate time to dock and maximum alignment offset Failures in
        early trials were analyzed and fed back into a design iteration cycle For
        example a failure mode where the vehicle overshot the docking target led to
        a change in approach velocity profile and a new braking strategy</p>

        <p>Overall the project demonstrates the importance of combining mechanical
        design with sensor fusion and robust control The testing program emphasized
        reproducible metrics and iterative improvement which are essential for field
        ready marine robotics systems Future work includes adding adaptive control
        to compensate for changing current and a more compact self cleaning latch
        design</p>

    - body: '<p>I completed the underwater camera calibration and vision processing
        assignment by first acquiring a diverse set of checkerboard images in a test
        tank. Images were captured at varying distances and angles while the camera
        was enclosed in a flat port housing to replicate typical field conditions.
        To address refraction at the housing interface I extended the standard pinhole
        model with a thin interface correction and detected checkerboard corners with
        subpixel accuracy. Calibration parameter estimation used OpenCV routines with
        custom constraints to stabilize the fit. Validation was performed by projecting
        known grid points back into image space and computing reprojection error.
        The mean reprojection error across validation frames was 0.42 pixels and the
        median error was 0.35 pixels which indicated consistent convergence.</p>

        <p>For vision processing I implemented white balance followed by channel wise
        histogram equalization to mitigate color cast due to blue green attenuation
        in water. Object detection used background subtraction combined with morphological
        opening and closing to remove spurious particles. Contour analysis provided
        centroids and bounding boxes which were then filtered by size and solidity
        to reduce false positives. I evaluated the pipeline on sequences with increasing
        turbidity and variable illumination. Results show that applying the calibrated
        undistortion reduced systematic localization bias by about 35 percent and
        improved tracking stability across frames.</p>

        <p>Deliverables include calibration scripts, processed sample images, raw
        captures, and a short report describing parameter choices, failure cases,
        and potential improvements. Suggested next steps are stereo calibration for
        depth recovery, incorporating a full refractive geometry solver, and capturing
        multispectral calibration targets for improved color restoration.</p>

        path length time to goal energy consumption and minimum distance to obstacles

    - body: <p>Autonomous underwater vehicles rely on complementary sensors to maintain
        accurate navigation in challenging environments. In this report I outline
        a common architecture that fuses measurements from an inertial measurement
        unit DVL and imaging or profiling sonar. The IMU provides high rate relative
        motion but drifts over time due to bias and noise. The DVL supplies velocity
        relative to the seabed when bottom lock is available which can bound IMU drift.
        Sonar measurements offer range or feature based updates that improve horizontal
        position estimates or provide loop closure in feature rich areas.</p><p>For
        state estimation an extended Kalman filter is often used to fuse inertial
        propagation with intermittent DVL and sonar updates. Key modeling choices
        include sensor noise covariance tuning bias models for the IMU and outlier
        rejection for sonar returns. Alternative estimators such as the unscented
        Kalman filter or factor graph optimizers can handle stronger nonlinearities
        or batch smoothing needs.</p><p>Error analysis should quantify how DVL dropout
        multipath in sonar and current induced drift affect position error growth.
        Practical mitigation includes adaptive covariance scaling multi rate filtering
        and using observability metrics to detect unbounded states. I recommend validating
        fusion designs with simulated sensor data followed by sea trials using ground
        truth from an LBL system when possible.</p><p>This assignment demonstrates
        that robust underwater navigation depends on careful sensor modeling and fusion
        algorithm choice as well as pragmatic engineering to handle real world failure
        modes.</p>

        vehicle using potential flow approximations and a viscous correction  for
        separated flow regions. The simulation approach combines a finite volume  solver
        for the Navier Stokes equations with a turbulence model suitable for  low
        Reynolds number regimes. Mesh generation, boundary conditions, and time  stepping
        are discussed along with stability constraints and recommended  discretization
        schemes. Validation is performed by comparing thrust and drag  coefficients
        from the numerical model against tow tank data and a benchmark  analytical
        solution for added mass. Results include sensitivity to mesh  refinement and
        time step size, and a brief performance analysis of solver  convergence and
        computational cost. The report concludes with recommendations  for extending
        the model to free surface effects and coupled vehicle control  simulations.</p>

    - body: '<p> This brief outlines a proposed sound zoning plan for the Riverside
        corridor to reduce nocturnal noise intrusion while supporting small business
        activity. After auditing existing sound sources and mapping sensitive receptors
        such as housing and schools, I propose three zones: Quiet Residential, Mixed
        Activity, and Commercial Activity. Quiet Residential would enforce stricter
        night time limits and require sound insulation standards for new developments.
        Mixed Activity zones would apply moderated limits and timed curfews for amplified
        outdoor events. Commercial Activity zones would allow higher daytime limits
        but impose monitoring and complaint response requirements. The plan recommends
        physical buffers like landscaped berms and strategically placed sound-absorbing
        surfaces, alongside policy tools such as conditional permits, time of operation
        restrictions, and a community noise reporting platform. Stakeholder engagement
        includes city planners, small business owners, residents, and public health
        officials. Funding for retrofits and monitoring can be sourced from a municipal
        environmental grant and a modest surcharge on late night permit fees. Implementation
        phases span pilot testing in year one, wider roll out in year two, and review
        with community feedback in year three. Metrics of success include reduced
        complaints, measured decibel reductions, and improved resident sleep quality.
        This brief concludes with recommended next steps for a pilot assessment and
        a timeline for regulatory drafting. </p>'

    - body: <p>I selected three sites for this study, located along a major avenue,
        a small park, and a mixed use plaza. At each site I recorded soundscape samples
        at three time windows, early morning, mid afternoon, and late evening, using
        a portable recorder and a smartphone for redundancy. I measured overall level
        using A weighted metrics and created spectrograms to visualize dominant frequency
        bands over time. The avenue recordings showed predictable peaks during peak
        traffic, with strong low frequency content, while the park exhibited more
        intermittent biological and human sounds in the morning, and the plaza was
        dominated by speech and mechanical noise in the afternoon. I correlated these
        patterns with observed human activity, weather conditions, and nearby land
        uses. I then proposed two interventions, adding vegetated acoustic barriers
        along the avenue and creating a sound oriented seating area in the plaza,

    - body: '<p> For this assignment I carried out a brief sonic intervention at a
        busy transit plaza adjacent to the main library. The objective was to subtly
        shift the sonic foreground of the site and to create moments of surprise that
        would encourage passersby to attend to the acoustic environment. I made a
        short composition from field recordings gathered on site combined with simple
        synthesized tones. The piece is three minutes long and was played at low volume
        through a portable speaker placed near a seating area for fifteen minutes
        during the midday rush. I recorded the surrounding ambient sounds before,
        during, and after playback and took field notes on pedestrian movement and
        facial expressions. </p>

        <p> In this submission I explain how I selected the location, the reasons
        behind the sound palette, the practical steps for deployment, and the measures
        I took to avoid causing discomfort. I connect observations of public reaction
        to ideas from acoustic ecology and soundscape design, and I reflect on how
        the intervention altered the perceived acoustic identity of the space. I include
        a short reflection on methodological limits and possible refinements for future
        iterations. </p>

    - body: <p>I interviewed a longtime market vendor who has worked at the same corner
        stall for more than twenty years. She described the day beginning with the
        call of early delivery trucks followed by a layered chorus of hawkers children
        and distant traffic that structures her routine. I recorded approximately
        five minutes of ambient sound while asking three open ended questions and
        annotated key moments at 00 45 01 30 and 03 10 where vendor calls a motorcycle
        delivery a brief ambulance siren and a large bus horn punctuated the conversation.
        In her responses certain tones were tied to memories of seasonal festivals
        and to feelings of belonging created by familiar vendor voices. Applying Schafer
        and Truax from our readings the market shows dense sound marks that form place
        identity even as intermittent intrusive noises from vehicles create moments
        of disturbance. I analyze how sound density and sound event sequencing shape
        listening practices and affect wellbeing for vendors and shoppers. For a practical
        design intervention I suggest soft buffering through planted hedgerows and
        modular street furniture paired with a timed delivery zone that limits heavy
        vehicle access during peak hours. This approach aims to preserve meaningful
        market sound marks while reducing harmful noise exposure. I conclude by reflecting
        on ethical listening and the need to center community preferences in any soundscape
        design process.</p>
      feedback:
        comment: Clear observational detail and solid theoretical links. The timestamps
          and intervention are helpful and grounded. To improve further add a short
          transcript excerpt to demonstrate voice and expand on metrics you would
          use to evaluate the intervention over time.

    - body: <p>For this lab report I recorded continuous sound level data at three
        sites in the downtown study area during weekday daytime hours. Equipment included
        a Class 2 sound level meter, a calibrated reference source used for pre and
        post calibration checks, and a field notebook to log weather and human activity
        observations. At each site I established a 15 minute measurement period at
        three heights above the ground and at consistent distances from major noise
        sources. Data processing involved applying A weighting and calculating equivalent
        continuous sound level Leq, along with Lmax and percentile levels such as
        L10 and L90 to characterize variability. I also generated 1 third octave band
        spectra to examine frequency content and identify dominant contributors such
        as traffic, HVAC systems, and pedestrian clusters. Results show systematic
        differences between the three locations with Site A dominated by vehicle flow
        producing higher low frequency energy, Site B influenced by mixed street activity
        with mid frequency peaks, and Site C quieter with higher L90 levels due to
        distant background noise. The report discusses possible sources of measurement
        error including microphone orientation, wind noise, and short term transient
        events, and outlines steps taken to mitigate these errors such as windshield
        use and excluding short anomalies in the analysis. In the discussion I link
        the findings to principles of urban soundscape design by suggesting interventions
        to improve perceived acoustic quality such as strategic vegetation, traffic
        calming, and source separation where feasible. The conclusion summarizes key
        metrics and recommends follow up measurements during evening and weekend periods
        to capture temporal variability. </p>

        listening to transient rich soundscapes will show higher detection thresholds
        and lower subjective clarity ratings than those in steady ambient conditions.
        We will recruit 40 undergraduate volunteers randomly assigned to the two conditions
        with 20 per group. Pre and post tests will measure tone detection thresholds
        using an adaptive staircase in a sound treated lab and participants will complete
        a brief questionnaire on perceived clarity and stress. Stimuli will be calibrated
        to safe listening levels and sessions will last under 45 minutes per participant.

      Participants will learn practical techniques for site selection microphone placement
      mobile recording and metadata logging while considering ethical issues such
      as privacy consent and community impact

      The workshop covers basic acoustic measurement methods soundwalking observational
      annotation and low cost recording setups as well as guidance on file management
      and data backup

      Students will work in small teams to plan a site visit conduct recordings produce
      a short interpretive report and present findings in a peer review session

      Safety and respect for public space are emphasized with instructions on situational
      awareness permissions and minimizing disturbance

      Deliverables include raw audio files annotated field notes a 3 page report and
      a 10 minute team presentation to be uploaded to the class platform

      Attendance participation and quality of documentation will factor into the assessment

    submissions:
    - body: '<p>I conducted a frequency analysis on a corpus of 350 Old Babylonian
        tablets to assess the relative occurrence of the sign KI and several related
        locative and grammatical signs. My first step was to produce a normalized
        sign list that grouped clear orthographic variants and identified common ligatures
        so that counts would reflect functional sign use rather than scribal variation.
        I transcribed the corpus into a consistent spreadsheet format and removed
        fragmentary readings where the sign could not be reliably identified.</p>

        <p>To account for differences in tablet length and genre I calculated raw
        counts and then converted counts to rates per 1000 signs. This allowed comparison
        across administrative, legal, and literary subsets. For hypothesis testing
        I used a chi square goodness of fit test to see whether the distribution of
        selected signs across genres departed from what would be expected by chance.
        Where pairwise comparisons were needed I applied z tests for proportions with
        a Bonferroni adjustment to control family wise error. I also computed confidence
        intervals for the main relative frequency estimates.</p>

        <p>The chi square test showed a significant deviation from a uniform distribution,
        with KI and related locatives markedly over represented in administrative
        texts. Pairwise tests confirmed that the proportion of KI in administrative
        texts was significantly higher than in literary texts. These quantitative
        results support a functional interpretation in which KI is being used more
        frequently in contexts requiring locative notation and commodity records.
        I supplement the statistical findings with qualitative paleographic observations:
        the shapes of KI in administrative tablets tend to be more compressed and
        standardized, consistent with rapid accounting handwriting, while literary
        examples show more variation in wedge order and ligature complexity.</p>

        <p>I discuss several limitations. The corpus is skewed toward published and
        well preserved tablets which may bias frequency estimates. Transcription choices
        influence counts, especially when distinguishing ligatures from adjacent signs.
        The statistical tests assume independence of observations, but scribal habit
        and multi sign units can violate that assumption. To address this I propose
        follow up analyses using mixed effects logistic regression with scribe identity
        as a random effect and network analysis to detect clusters of co occurring
        signs.</p>

        <p>In conclusion, the statistical evidence combined with paleographic inspection
        points to functional and scribal factors driving sign frequency patterns in
        the sample. I include an appendix with the cleaned CSV, code snippets for
        the chi square and proportion tests, and two figures showing normalized frequency
        by genre and a heatmap of co occurrence. </p>

    - body: '<p>Working through this digital edition pushed me to confront several
        practical and theoretical issues in paleography. I began by making a diplomatic
        transcription line by line from the high resolution image supplied in the
        course site. Where signs were damaged or missing I recorded lacunae explicitly
        and used brackets to indicate restorations. Moving from the diplomatic transcription
        to a normalized transliteration required consistent decisions about sign values
        and logographic readings. I kept a running sign list to track ambiguous readings
        and noted where contemporary sign lists disagreed.</p>

        <p>Encoding the text in TEI made the editorial choices visible and reproducible.
        I used separate elements for damage markup, uncertain readings, and editorial
        restorations so that future users could distinguish original traces from my
        interventions. One challenge was representing line joins and broken wedges
        that could belong to multiple signs. In those cases I recorded alternatives
        and referenced comparable signs from parallel texts to justify my preferred
        reading. This practice highlighted the tension between producing a readable
        edition and preserving the evidence of uncertainty.</p>

        <p>Annotating paleographic variants led me to consult the secondary literature
        and the sign repertory. I recorded variant shapes and provided brief comments
        on their likely chronological and regional affinities. This process underscored
        how paleographic judgments affect dating and provenance. Finally I composed
        a short commentary that links the tablet content with broader historical questions
        and explains the editorial principles I followed. Creating a digital edition
        has strengthened my appreciation for transparent markup and for documenting
        every step of the editorial process.</p>'

        began with high resolution normal light photography using a tripod and controlled
        aperture to preserve depth of field. I then used raking light at low angles
        to emphasize incision depth and shadow. Next I assembled an RTI series with
        forty images from different light positions and processed them to generate
        specular enhancement and normal maps. I also captured a photogrammetry set
        to create a textured 3D model for virtual manipulation. Finally I experimented
        with near infrared imaging which revealed faint signs of pigment that were
        not visible in the visible spectrum. In analysis I compared the different
        outputs and showed how RTI and raking light were most effective for improving
        letter edge contrast while photogrammetry provided accurate shape context.
        I included processing parameters and a short reflection on challenges such
        as stabilization of small fragments and balancing exposure to avoid highlight
        clipping. I propose a refined workflow for future sessions that prioritizes
        RTI plus targeted multispectral shots for suspected painted areas.</p>

    submissions:
    - body: <p>For this catalog I examined tablets from the assigned Old Babylonian
        corpus and identified 22 candidate sign variants. Each entry includes a cropped
        image of the sign, a line drawing highlighting variant strokes, a proposed
        transliteration, and notes on positional variants within words. I recorded
        the contexts in which each variant appears and tabulated occurrences by tablet
        and line number. In the analytic summary I argue that variation clusters around
        a small set of stroke alternations that are consistent with regional scribal
        habits rather than random error. I also discuss how training exercises that
        emphasize stroke sequence could account for the transmission patterns observed.
        Where possible I propose provisional dates and provenance based on tablet
        findspot information and paleographic comparisons to published sign lists.
        Materials and images are provided as separate files and all catalogue entries
        include cross references to the relevant corpus identifiers.</p>

          to sign lists from Old Babylonian corpus to strengthen dating arguments.

    - body: <p>For this project I attempted a physical reconstruction of a fragmented
        wax tablet thought to contain brief administrative notations. I began by photographing
        each fragment under raking light and measuring edge profiles. I produced scaled
        joins on tracing film to test potential fits without touching originals. Once
        probable joins were identified I prepared a conservation grade, reversible
        adhesive and a wax fill recipe compatible with historical materials. Reconstruction
        occurred on a padded support to avoid stress on joins. After joins were consolidated
        I made a color matched fill only where loss prevented structural stability.
        I completed the workflow with a structured 3D scan, a full transcription of
        legible impressions, and a short comparative analysis with known administrative
        formulas to infer the object function.</p>

    - body: <p>For this case study I examine Tablets A B and C and argue that Tablet
        A belongs to the late Old Babylonian period based on the rounded wedge endings
        and the compact sign spacing. Tablet B shows elongated vertical wedges and
        a tendency toward simplified composite signs which I read as evidence for
        an early first millennium context. Tablet C is more difficult to place and
        could be a provincial hand from the late second millennium given the irregular
        ductus and occasional variant sign forms. I compare each tablet to dated exemplars
        from the corpus and note areas of uncertainty where wear and restoration affect

        wedges typical of Old Babylonian school practice. Several signs show compressed
        horizontal wedges which suggest a stylus with a narrow tip. The sign for dingir
        appears with a shortened upper wedge in line 2 which may reflect a rapid hand
        or regional variant. Line endings show a tendency to omit full separating
        marks which creates uncertainty between sign boundaries. I consulted two standard
        sign lists when identifying problematic signs and variants. Lacunae are present
        in the center of the tablet and where breaks occur I have proposed restorations
        based on parallel phrases in Old Babylonian correspondence. Overall the transcription
        is provisional where damage obscures wedge orientation. Specific uncertainties
        are noted inline and correlated with sign list entries.</p>

  - Ability to date and classify cuneiform tablets
  pages:
  - body: 'Neo Assyrian scribal hands represent distinct styles of cuneiform writing
      that emerged in northern Mesopotamia during the early first millennium BCE   These
      hands are recognized by consistent choices in wedge angle, stroke order, sign
      proportions, and characteristic ductus that vary between individual scribes
      and institutional schools   Paleographers rely on comparative analysis of dated
      tablets to attribute unsigned fragments to particular scribes or archives and
      to refine chronological sequences for the Neo Assyrian period   Diagnostic features
      include the tilt and length of horizontal wedges, the curvature of angled strokes,
      recurrent ligature patterns, and the relative sizing of common signs across
      administrative, legal, and literary corpora   High resolution imaging and quantitative
      shape analysis complement traditional visual study and allow students to test
      hypotheses about scribal training, apprenticeship networks, and regional conventions   In
      this course students will practice safe handling of tablets, sign tracing, transliteration,
      and statistical attribution methods while learning to balance paleographic signals
      with archaeological and provenience data   Thorough documentation and ethical
      attention to context are essential to avoid overreach in attribution and to
      support responsible research on ancient scribal communities
