Observational techniques such as transit and eclipse spectroscopy, direct imaging, and phase curve analysis provide constraints on molecular composition, thermal profiles, and cloud properties. Important physical and chemical processes include atmospheric escape driven by stellar irradiation, photochemistry that can create or destroy potential biosignatures, and radiative transfer that governs greenhouse warming. Candidate biosignature gases like water vapor, oxygen, ozone, methane, and carbon dioxide must be interpreted with care to avoid abiotic false positives caused by geophysical or stellar effects. Modeling tools range from one dimensional radiative convective calculations to three dimensional general circulation models, each with trade offs in complexity and computational cost. This page summarizes diagnostic observables, best practice approaches for atmospheric retrievals, common pitfalls in habitability inference, and recent mission capabilities relevant to the field. Students will find recommended readings, data sets for hands on practice, and questions for critical evaluation of current claims about habitable worlds. Active participation in data interpretation exercises is encouraged to develop skills in uncertainty quantification and hypothesis testing"}}]},{"id":"2fb04821-58a4-4b0e-90b9-2b24882f4582","type":"Information Seeking","answer_type":"Numeric","parameterized_text":"Task: In the course \"[[Course]]\" use the Quizzes page to find the quiz titled \"[[Quiz]]\", report the number of questions this quiz has.","parameters":["Course","Quiz"],"instances":[{"id":"bcb76b2b-2076-47dd-aef0-f22cc8f41740","instance_text":"Task: In the course \"Astrobiology and Planetary Habitability 312\" use the Quizzes page to find the quiz titled \"Mars and Icy Moon Environments\", report the number of questions this quiz has.","instance_username":"riley.parker@instituterson.ca","instance_password":"hG7r9Kp2VzQ1","mapping":{"Course":"Astrobiology and Planetary Habitability 312","Quiz":"Mars and Icy Moon Environments"},"answer_key":{"Number":3}}]},{"id":"353feae6-0efa-4913-8220-8ab2567696b4","type":"Information Seeking","answer_type":"Date Time","parameterized_text":"Task: In the \"[[Group]]\" group, view the revision history of the page titled \"[[Page]]\" and identify the most recent edit and report when it was made.","parameters":["Group","Page"],"instances":[{"id":"bbb2ecd9-0a44-4614-8815-277c2c23deca","instance_text":"Task: In the \"Red Dwarf Study Group\" group, view the revision history of the page titled \"Notes on flares and habitability\" and identify the most recent edit and report when it was made.","instance_username":"riley.parker@instituterson.ca","instance_password":"hG7r9Kp2VzQ1","mapping":{"Group":"Red Dwarf Study Group","Page":"Notes on flares and habitability"},"answer_key":{"Date Time":"2026-02-15 00:00"}}]},{"id":"37949dc8-cc9a-46ec-9a04-9fc70de7739a","type":"Information Seeking","answer_type":"Date Time","parameterized_text":"Task: In the course \"[[Course]]\" use the Assignments page to search for the assignment titled \"[[Assignment]]\".
