Students will learn methods for rapid policy sketching, narrative prototyping, and low fidelity testing with community personas to surface unintended consequences and power dynamics.\nFormat and schedule - Three live sessions plus an asynchronous sprint. Session 1 - Framing constraints and norm mapping; Session 2 - Prototyping techniques and peer testing; Session 3 - Public feedback simulation and final pitches. Asynchronous work includes research, prototype development, and a reflective journal entry between sessions.\nCore activities - Rapid policy sketching and policy artifact creation; Scenario mapping and impact ladders; Persona based role play and tabletop testing; Creation of tangible engagement assets such as visual briefs, mock public notices, and short performative scripts to surface public responses.\nDeliverables and assessment - Team submission of two artifacts: a concise speculative policy brief and a prototype engagement asset. Assessment split includes peer feedback for 20 percent, instructor evaluation for 50 percent, and the reflective journal for 30 percent. Rubrics focus on plausibility, ethical reflection, clarity of public benefit, and attention to equity.\nEthical guidance - Prototypes must avoid causing harm and must surface who benefits and who may be disadvantaged. Each submission needs a mitigation plan for potential harms and a plan for consent and data minimization when testing with people.\nSample LMS discussion excerpt - Instructor - Please document key assumptions behind your prototypes and test them with at least two distinct community perspectives. Student A - We are prototyping a skills linked basic support policy and want feedback on how to make trade offs legible. Student B - Consider a pilot metric set that centers lived experience and access rather than only economic outputs. Instructor - Strong idea, draft a short evaluation plan before the next session for peer review.\nSupport and logistics - Virtual office hours Thursdays 3 to 4 PM and by appointment. Upload draft artifacts to the workshop folder by Friday midnight to allow time for peer review and instructor comments."}},{"id":"8a09a14c-94d0-490e-bba7-6c4cf8f4aa7c","instance_text":"Task: In the course \"Urban Agroecology and Food Systems 341\" view the page titled \"Urban Soil Health and Community Food Networks\" by navigating to the Pages Index and selecting the page from the list.
