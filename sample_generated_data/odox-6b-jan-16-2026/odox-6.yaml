    - body: <p> In this assignment I calculated the contribution of long lived radionuclides
        to the heat budget of a hypothetical rocky exoplanet. I began by estimating
        the abundances of potassium forty uranium two thirty eight and thorium two
        thirty two based on chondritic ratios scaled to the planet mass. Using published
        decay constants and energy per decay values I computed volumetric heating
        rates and then integrated over the mantle volume to get a global power. My
        results indicate that radionuclide heating alone can sustain a magma ocean
        for several hundred million years if initial abundances are high, but with
        lower abundances the heat production declines rapidly leading to early mantle
        solidification. I discussed how this heating interacts with other heat sources
        such as accretional energy and tidal dissipation and how it influences core
        formation and dynamo activity. I also examined observational constraints and
        sources of uncertainty including composition heterogeneity and partitioning
        of heat producing elements into crustal reservoirs. Finally I connected these
        calculations to habitability by considering the implications for long term
        surface temperature regulation and internal magnetic shielding. </p>

    - body: <p>For my submission I examined thermal infrared imaging and multispectral
        reflectance observations as applied to Mars analog field sites. Thermal infrared
        sensors capture surface temperature contrasts that can indicate active geothermal
        processes or subsurface ice, while multispectral data reveal mineralogical
        signatures tied to water alteration. In a recent field campaign I saw how
        an initial interpretation based on daytime thermal contrast suggested active
        outgassing, but follow up measurements revealed the effect was due to dark
        rock exposure and solar heating. This demonstrates the importance of accounting
        for observation geometry and diurnal cycles when interpreting remote data.
        A robust analysis uses multiple sensors, ground truth where possible, and
        models of environmental confounders. I discuss a case study of the detection
        of phyllosilicates in an ancient basin, how instrument spectral resolution
        affected confidence, and how combined datasets reduced false positive risk.
        Finally I reflect on the implications for target selection in future missions
        and on how methodological awareness can improve habitability assessments.</p>

        planetary habitability. On Earth the carbon cycle links atmospheric CO2 to
        biological activity and long term climate regulation via rock weathering and
        sedimentation. Changes to that cycle can produce strong climate feedbacks
        that either stabilize surface conditions or push the planet toward extreme
        greenhouse or snowball states. The water cycle governs the availability and
        distribution of liquid on the surface through evaporation condensation and

        <p>Comparative examples highlight the role of cycling. Mars shows geological
        signs of a formerly active water cycle yet lost much of its volatiles and
        atmosphere leaving the surface cold and dry. Europa on the other hand appears
        to host a subsurface ocean maintained by tidal heating where water and potential
        chemical exchange with the rocky interior could sustain habitable niches despite
        the absence of surface liquid water. These contrasts illustrate that both
        the presence of key volatiles and the rates and pathways of their cycling
        determine long term habitability.</p>

        <p>Integrating observational constraints with simple box models clarifies
        how fluxes and reservoir sizes set residence times and climate sensitivity.
        For further work I will quantify typical flux magnitudes and compare their
        timescales to biological and geological processes to better define habitability
        boundaries.</p>'

    - body: '<p>In this report I examine the factors that control habitability on
        super Earths with masses between two and ten Earth masses. Observational surveys
        show a wide diversity in mass and radius among these planets, which implies
        a range of bulk compositions from predominantly rocky to volatile rich. A
        key determinant of surface habitability is whether the planet can retain a
        secondary atmosphere that supports stable surface temperatures and liquid
        water. Higher gravity on many super Earths favors atmosphere retention but
        vigorous early stellar irradiation and strong stellar winds can drive significant
        atmospheric escape for planets close to active stars. </p>

        <p>Internal structure and heat budget are central to long term habitability.
        Larger mantle reservoirs and elevated radiogenic heating can sustain mantle
        convection and possibly plate like behavior for longer periods than on Earth.
        Sustained tectonics supports carbon cycling and stabilizes climate through
        long term weathering feedbacks. Conversely, a stagnant lid regime could limit
        surface recycling and reduce the likelihood of long term stable climates.
        The presence and strength of a dynamo generated magnetic field also matters
        because it can mitigate atmospheric loss driven by stellar particle flux.
        Dynamo lifetime depends on core size, composition, and cooling rate, which
        in turn relate to formation history and volatile inventory. </p>

        <p>Stellar environment and orbital dynamics impose additional constraints.
        Planets orbiting low mass M dwarfs face high levels of extreme ultraviolet
        radiation and flares early in their history. Tidal effects can lead to synchronous
        rotation for close in planets which alters climate patterns but does not by
        itself preclude habitable conditions if heat redistribution is efficient.
        For planets in wider orbits around Sun like stars, insolation variability
        is less severe and the classical habitable zone concept is more directly applicable.
        </p>

        <p>Ultimately habitability of any given super Earth is a product of interacting
        factors including mass and radius, volatile inventory, internal heating and
        tectonics, magnetic shielding, and the activity history of the host star.
        Future observations that constrain bulk composition, atmospheric spectra,
        and stellar activity histories will be critical. This synthesis highlights
        the need to couple interior evolution models with atmospheric escape calculations
        and climate models to assess habitability probabilities across the observed
        population of super Earths. </p>

  outcomes:
  - Ability to evaluate planetary habitability and identify potential biosignatures
  pages:
  - body: 'Exoplanet atmospheres are a primary determinant of planetary habitability
      because they control surface temperature, shield against harmful radiation,
      and mediate volatile cycles. Observational techniques such as transit and eclipse
      spectroscopy, direct imaging, and phase curve analysis provide constraints on
      molecular composition, thermal profiles, and cloud properties. Important physical
      and chemical processes include atmospheric escape driven by stellar irradiation,
      photochemistry that can create or destroy potential biosignatures, and radiative
      transfer that governs greenhouse warming. Candidate biosignature gases like
      water vapor, oxygen, ozone, methane, and carbon dioxide must be interpreted
      with care to avoid abiotic false positives caused by geophysical or stellar
      effects. Modeling tools range from one dimensional radiative convective calculations
      to three dimensional general circulation models, each with trade offs in complexity
      and computational cost. This page summarizes diagnostic observables, best practice
      approaches for atmospheric retrievals, common pitfalls in habitability inference,
      and recent mission capabilities relevant to the field. Students will find recommended
      readings, data sets for hands on practice, and questions for critical evaluation
      of current claims about habitable worlds. Active participation in data interpretation
      exercises is encouraged to develop skills in uncertainty quantification and
      hypothesis testing
