      Page: Exoplanet Atmospheres and Habitability
    :answer_key:
      :Text: Exoplanet atmospheres are a primary determinant of planetary habitability
        because they control surface temperature, shield against harmful radiation,
        and mediate volatile cycles. Observational techniques such as transit and
        eclipse spectroscopy, direct imaging, and phase curve analysis provide constraints
        on molecular composition, thermal profiles, and cloud properties. Important
        physical and chemical processes include atmospheric escape driven by stellar
        irradiation, photochemistry that can create or destroy potential biosignatures,
        and radiative transfer that governs greenhouse warming. Candidate biosignature
        gases like water vapor, oxygen, ozone, methane, and carbon dioxide must be
        interpreted with care to avoid abiotic false positives caused by geophysical
        or stellar effects. Modeling tools range from one dimensional radiative convective
        calculations to three dimensional general circulation models, each with trade
        offs in complexity and computational cost. This page summarizes diagnostic
        observables, best practice approaches for atmospheric retrievals, common pitfalls
        in habitability inference, and recent mission capabilities relevant to the
        field. Students will find recommended readings, data sets for hands on practice,
        and questions for critical evaluation of current claims about habitable worlds.
        Active participation in data interpretation exercises is encouraged to develop
        skills in uncertainty quantification and hypothesis testing
